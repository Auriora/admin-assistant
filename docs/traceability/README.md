# Traceability Documentation

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Approved
- **Created Date**: 27-10-2023
- **Last Updated**: 27-10-2023

## 1. Purpose

**When to use this template**: This folder holds documents that link project artifacts together to ensure completeness and provide an audit trail. For example, a traceability matrix can connect requirements to the design decisions, code, and tests that satisfy them.
**Location**: `docs/traceability/`

## 2. What Belongs Here?

- Traceability matrices (e.g., Requirements Traceability Matrix).
- Documents linking requirements to design, implementation, and test cases.
- Audit trails for critical decisions or changes.

## 3. What Does NOT Belong Here?

- Raw requirements (see `../1-requirements/`).
- Detailed design documents (see `../2-architecture/`).
- Test plans (see `../4-testing/`).

## 4. Usage Notes

- **Checklist for Authors**:
  - [ ] Fill in all placeholder values (e.g., `[Name or Team]`).
  - [ ] Delete this `Usage Notes` section before publishing.
  - [ ] Ensure the document is linked from the relevant `README.md` file.

- **Naming Convention**: N/A for this file.

## 5. Available Templates

- `_template.md`: A generic template for any traceability document.
