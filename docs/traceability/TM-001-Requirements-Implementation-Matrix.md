## Gap Analysis

### High Priority Gaps

1. **Timesheet Generation (FR-BIL-001 to FR-BIL-005)**
   - **Impact**: Core business functionality missing
   - **Recommendation**: Implement as next priority (see CAP-001)

2. **Travel Management (FR-TRV-001 to FR-TRV-004)**
   - **Impact**: Workflow efficiency feature missing
   - **Recommendation**: Implement after timesheet generation

3. **External Integrations (FR-EXT-001 to FR-EXT-004)**
   - **Impact**: Business process automation missing
   - **Recommendation**: Implement based on business priority

### Medium Priority Gaps

1. **Performance Testing**
   - **Impact**: Production readiness unknown
   - **Recommendation**: Implement performance test suite

2. **End-to-End Testing**
   - **Impact**: Integration confidence could be higher
   - **Recommendation**: Expand E2E test coverage

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next Sprint)
1. Complete timesheet generation implementation
2. Add performance testing framework
3. Expand end-to-end test coverage

### Short Term (Next Month)
1. Implement travel management features
2. Add comprehensive performance tests
3. Begin external integration development

### Long Term (Next Quarter)
1. Complete external integrations
2. Implement advanced features
3. Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
