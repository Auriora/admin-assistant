# High-Level Design: Command-Line Interface

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Created Date**: DD-MM-YYYY
- **Last Updated**: DD-MM-YYYY
- **Audience**: [Developers, SRE, Power Users]

## 1. Purpose

The Admin Assistant CLI provides a command-line interface for administrative, maintenance, and automation tasks. It enables advanced users, system administrators, and automated scripts to interact with the system without using the web UI, serving as a first-class interface alongside the web application.

## 2. Context

The CLI is designed as a thin layer over the core business logic and services. This ensures feature parity and consistent behavior with the web UI. By invoking the same core services, it maintains a single source of truth for all business operations, whether triggered by a user in the browser or a script via the command line.

## 3. Details

### 3.1. Supported Use Cases

- **Archiving:** Trigger calendar archiving for a user or date range.
- **Export:** Generate and export timesheets, reports, or other data extracts.
- **User Management:** List, add, or deactivate users (for administrators).
- **Diagnostics:** Run health checks, view logs, or test integrations.
- **Automation:** Schedule or script any supported operation for headless or batch execution.

### 3.2. Architecture and Core Interaction

- The CLI is implemented in the `cli/` directory using Python's Typer or Click library for argument parsing and help generation.
- All CLI commands invoke core services directly, using the same repository and service abstractions as the web front end and background jobs.

### 3.3. Security and Auditability

- Sensitive CLI operations (e.g., user management, data export) require authentication and authorization.
- All actions performed via the CLI are logged with the user, timestamp, and command details to ensure full auditability.
- The CLI must not expose secrets or sensitive data in its output or logs.

### 3.4. Example Command Structure

```bash
$ admin-assistant-cli --help
Usage: admin-assistant-cli [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  archive      Archive calendar data for a user/date range
  export       Export timesheet or report
  user         User management commands
  diagnostics  Run system diagnostics
  ...

$ admin-assistant-cli archive --user alice@example.com --start 2024-06-01 --end 2024-06-07
Archive completed for user alice@example.com (7 appointments archived)
```
