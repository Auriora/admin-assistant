@startuml
actor Admin
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "User/Role DB" as DB

Admin -> UI: Navigates to User/Role Management page
UI -> BE: Request user/role data
BE -> DB: Fetch user/role info
DB --> BE: Return data
BE -> UI: Show user/role list
Admin -> UI: Adds/edits/deletes user or role
UI -> BE: Save changes
BE -> DB: Update user/role info
BE -> UI: Confirm update, show status
User -> UI: Logs in, accesses data
UI -> BE: Enforce user/role isolation
BE -> DB: Fetch user-specific data
DB --> BE: Return data
BE -> UI: Show user data

## Detailed Flow Description

### Entry Points
- Admin navigates to User/Role Management page
- User logs in or accesses data

### Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      | UI Elements                | Notes                                  |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1      | Admin        | Navigates to User/Role Management page      | Loads user/role list                                 | User/Role list, controls   |                                        |
| 2      | Admin        | Adds, edits, or deletes user or role        | Sends change to backend                              | Add/Edit/Delete controls   |                                        |
| 3      | Backend      | Updates user/role info in DB                | Confirms update or shows error                       | N/A                        |                                        |
| 4      | User         | Logs in, accesses data                      | System enforces user/role isolation                  | User dashboard, data views |                                        |
| 5      | Backend      | Fetches user-specific data                  | Returns only authorized data                         | N/A                        |                                        |
| 6      | Backend      | Confirms access or shows error              | Shows data or access denied message                  | Success/Error notification  |                                        |

### Exit Points
- User/role changes are saved and reflected in access control
- User accesses only their own data
- Admin is notified of any errors and can resolve them
- System logs all user/role actions for audit purposes

### Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario         | Trigger                                 | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Unauthorized Access   | User attempts to access another's data   | Denies access, logs event                       | User sees access denied message      |
| Role Escalation       | User attempts unauthorized role change   | Denies action, logs event                       | User sees error, admin notified      |
| Save Failure          | Backend/database error                   | Shows error, allows retry                       | Retry save                          |
| Auth Expired          | User session/token expired               | Prompts user to re-authenticate                 | Log in again                        |

## UI Components
- User/Role management page (admin)
- User/Role list and controls
- User dashboard and data views
- Success/Error notification banners or modals

## Accessibility Considerations
- All controls accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for controls and error messages
- Clear, actionable error messages and prompts

## Performance Expectations
- User/role changes and access checks should complete within a second
- UI should remain responsive during backend operations
- System should handle access and save errors gracefully

## Related Flows
- Authentication Flow
- Audit Log and Export (UXF-AUD-001)
- Error Notification Flow (UXF-NOT-001)

## Notes
- All user/role actions are logged for audit and compliance
- Future: Support for more granular permissions and external directory integration
