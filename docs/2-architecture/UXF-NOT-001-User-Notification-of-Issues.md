## Flow Information
- **Flow ID**: UXF-NOT-001
- **Flow Name**: User Notification of Issues
- **Created By**: [Your Name]
- **Creation Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Related Requirements**: FR-NOT-001; UC-NOT-001
- **Priority**: High

## Extended Flow Objective
Notify users of missing/conflicting data, errors, or important system events via configurable channels (email, in-app/toast, or both), supporting progress updates, state, and percentage complete. Notifications are updatable by transaction_id and user preferences determine delivery channel. UI allows marking as read and visually distinguishes channel and state.

## User Personas
- Professional user (primary, single-user scenario)
- (Future) Admin or support user (for troubleshooting)

## Preconditions
- User is authenticated via Microsoft account
- User has granted necessary permissions to the application
- System detects an issue requiring user attention

actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
participant "Notification Service" as Notify

BE -> Notify: Detects issue, triggers notification
Notify -> UI: In-app notification
Notify -> User: Email notification (if configured)
User -> UI: Views notification, takes action

## Detailed Flow Description

### Entry Points
- System detects a missing/conflicting data or error during any user or background operation.
- User receives notification via in-app banner, modal, or email.

### Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      | UI Elements                | Notes                                  |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1      | System       | Detects event/issue or task progress        | Triggers notification via configured channels        | N/A                        | Can be in-app, email, or both          |
| 2      | Notification | Creates/updates notification (by transaction_id), sets progress, state, pct_complete | User receives notification with progress/state       | Notification banner/email   | Progress bar, state badge, channel icon|
| 3      | User         | Views notification, sees progress/state     | System logs user action/response                     | Notification panel, links, mark as read |                                        |
| 4      | User         | Marks notification as read or takes action  | System updates notification, logs response           | Mark as read button/icon    |                                        |
| 5      | User         | Changes notification preferences            | System updates delivery channel for future events    | Preferences UI/table        |                                        |
| 6      | System       | Logs notification and user response         | Updates audit log                                    | N/A                        |                                        |

### Exit Points
- User is notified of the issue and can take corrective action.
- System logs all notifications and user responses for audit purposes.

### Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario         | Trigger                                 | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Notification Failure  | Email/in-app notification fails          | Logs error, retries or uses fallback channel    | User may not receive notification   |
| Auth Expired          | User session/token expired               | Prompts user to re-authenticate                 | Log in again                        |

## UI Components
- Notification banners, modals, or panel in-app
- Email notification template
- Notification settings/configuration page (user can toggle channel per notification class)
- Progress bar, state badge, channel icon in notification UI
- Mark as read button/icon

## Accessibility Considerations
- All notifications accessible via screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for notification banners
- Clear, actionable notification content

## Performance Expectations
- Notifications should be delivered within a few seconds of issue detection
- UI should remain responsive during notification delivery
- System should handle notification errors gracefully

## Related Flows
- All flows that may generate user-facing issues (e.g., archiving, export, travel, etc.)
- Error Notification Flow (self-referential)

## Notes
- All notifications and user responses are logged for audit and compliance
- Future: Support for multi-user and admin troubleshooting
