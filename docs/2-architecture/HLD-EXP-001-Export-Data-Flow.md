# High-Level Design: Export Data Flow

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [Developers, UX Designers, Product Managers]

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the high-level design and user flow for exporting data (e.g., timesheets, audit logs) from the Admin Assistant application. The primary objective is to allow users to export data in multiple formats (CSV, Excel, PDF) reliably, ensuring data integrity and handling special characters and large datasets.

## 2. Context

- **User Personas**: The primary user is a professional managing their own administrative tasks. Future considerations include admin or support users for troubleshooting.
- **Preconditions**:
  - The user must be authenticated via their Microsoft account.
  - The application must have the necessary permissions.
  - Exportable data must exist within the system.

## 3. Details

### 3.1. Flow Diagram

```mermaid
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "Archive/Export Data" as Data

User -> UI: Navigates to Export page or triggers export
UI -> BE: Request export (selects format, date range, etc.)
BE -> Data: Fetch data for export
BE -> BE: Generate file in selected format
BE -> UI: Provide download link or file
User -> UI: Downloads file

### 3.2. Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor   | Action                                      | System Response                                      |
|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | User    | Navigates to Export page or triggers export | Loads export options (formats, date range, etc.)     |
| 2      | User    | Selects format, date range, clicks Export   | Sends export request to backend                      |
| 3      | Backend | Fetches data for export                     | Returns data or error                                |
| 4      | Backend | Generates file in selected format           | Provides download link or file                       |
| 5      | User    | Downloads file                              | System logs export action                            |

### 3.3. Error Scenarios

| Scenario           | Trigger                           | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Export Failure     | File generation or download error | Shows an error message and allows a retry.      | Retry the export.         |
| Data Fetch Failure | Backend or database error         | Shows an error message and allows a retry.      | Retry the data fetch.     |
| Auth Expired       | User session or token has expired | Prompts the user to re-authenticate.            | Log in again.             |

### 3.4. Design Considerations

- **UI Components**: The UI will include an export page with a format selector, date range picker, and an export button. Success/error notifications will be provided.
- **Accessibility**: All controls will be accessible via keyboard and screen readers, with sufficient color contrast and clear, actionable error messages.
- **Performance**: Exports should complete within a few seconds for typical data volumes. The UI must remain responsive during backend operations.
