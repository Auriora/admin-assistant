# High-Level Design: AI Integration and Recommendations

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [Developers, UX Designers, Product Managers]

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the high-level design for integrating the OpenAI API to provide AI-powered recommendations and automation (e.g., for appointment categorization and rule generation). The design ensures user review and control, data privacy through sanitization, and robust error handling.

## 2. Context

- **User Personas**: The primary user is a professional seeking to automate and streamline their administrative tasks.
- **Preconditions**:
  - The user must be authenticated.
  - The AI integration must be enabled and configured in the system.

## 3. Details

### 3.1. Flow Diagram

```mermaid
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
participant "OpenAI API" as AI

User -> UI: Triggers AI-powered action (e.g., categorize)
UI -> BE: Request AI recommendation
BE -> AI: Send sanitized, anonymized data
AI --> BE: Return recommendation
BE -> UI: Show recommendation, allow review/override
User -> UI: Reviews/overrides recommendation
UI -> BE: Save final decision
BE -> UI: Confirm update, show status

### 3.2. Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | User/System  | Triggers an AI-powered action.              | The system prepares and sanitizes the necessary data.|
| 2      | Backend      | Sends the sanitized data to the OpenAI API. | Receives a recommendation or an error.               |
| 3      | Backend      | Returns the recommendation to the UI.       | Displays the suggestion and allows user review.      |
| 4      | User         | Reviews and optionally overrides the suggestion.| Sends the final decision to the backend.             |
| 5      | Backend      | Saves the final decision.                   | Confirms the update or shows an error.               |

### 3.3. Error Scenarios

| Scenario          | Trigger                                     | System Response                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| AI Unavailable    | The OpenAI API is down or returns an error. | Notifies the user and allows a retry or manual action. |
| Privacy Violation | Data is not properly sanitized/anonymized.  | The request is blocked, and the error is logged. |
| Save Failure      | A backend or database error occurs.         | An error message is shown, allowing a retry.    |

### 3.4. Design Considerations

- **UI Components**: The UI will include action buttons to trigger AI features and a recommendation field with `Accept` and `Override` options.
- **Data Privacy**: All data sent to the OpenAI API must be sanitized and anonymized to protect user privacy.
- **Persistent Chat**: For features like overlap resolution, a persistent chat interface will be used, storing the history of the AI interaction.
