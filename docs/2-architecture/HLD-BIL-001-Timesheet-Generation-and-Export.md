# High-Level Design: Timesheet Generation and Export

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [Developers, UX Designers, Product Managers]

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the high-level design for generating, reviewing, and exporting categorized timesheets. The objective is to allow users to create timesheets for a selected date range in various formats (PDF, CSV, Excel) and optionally upload them to services like OneDrive or Xero. The flow must ensure accuracy, user control, and compliance with billing and privacy requirements.

## 2. Context

- **User Personas**: The primary user is a professional managing their own billing and administrative tasks.
- **Preconditions**:
  - The user must be authenticated.
  - The archive calendar must be populated with categorized appointments.
  - A PDF template must be available, or a default will be used.

### 3.1. Flow Diagram

```mermaid
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "Archive Calendar" as Archive
participant "OneDrive/Xero API" as OD
participant "PDF/Export Service" as Export

User -> UI: Selects date range, clicks "Generate Timesheet"
UI -> BE: Send timesheet generation request
BE -> Archive: Fetch appointments for range
BE -> Export: Categorize, generate PDF/CSV/Excel
Export --> BE: Return file
BE -> OD: Upload to OneDrive/Xero
OD --> BE: Confirm upload
BE -> UI: Show download link, upload status, errors

### 3.2. Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor   | Action                                      | System Response                                      |
|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | User    | Navigates to the Timesheet/Export page.     | Loads export options and available date ranges.      |
| 2      | User    | Selects a date range and clicks "Generate". | Sends a request to the backend.                      |
| 3      | Backend | Fetches appointments from the archive.      | Receives appointment data for the date range.        |
| 4      | Backend | Categorizes appointments.                   | Prompts the user for any ambiguous categories.       |
| 5      | Backend | Generates the timesheet file (PDF/CSV/Excel).| Returns the generated file or an error.              |
| 6      | Backend | Uploads the file to OneDrive/Xero.          | Confirms the upload or returns an error.             |
| 7      | Backend | Returns the result to the UI.               | Displays a download link, upload status, and errors. |

### 3.3. Error Scenarios

| Scenario             | Trigger                                     | System Response                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| API Failure          | An error occurs with the OneDrive/Xero API. | Shows an error and allows a retry.              |
| PDF Template Missing | The template is not found or is corrupt.    | Uses a default template and notifies the user.  |
| Ambiguous Category   | An appointment cannot be auto-categorized.  | Prompts the user for manual input.              |
| Export Failure       | An error occurs during file generation.     | Shows an error and allows a retry.              |

### 3.4. Design Considerations

- **UI Components**: The UI will include a dedicated page for timesheets with a date picker, export options, and a generation button. It will also feature prompts for category overrides and status indicators for uploads.
- **Accessibility**: All controls will be accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- **Performance**: Timesheet generation should be fast, and the UI must remain responsive during backend operations.
