# High-Level Design: Out-of-Office Automation

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [Developers, UX Designers, Product Managers]

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the high-level design for automatically marking calendar appointments as "Out-of-Office" (OOO). The objective is to ensure a consistent calendar status for a specified period, which supports user privacy, accurate scheduling, and compliance with organizational policies.

## 2. Context

- **User Personas**: The primary user is a professional managing their own calendar.
- **Preconditions**:
  - The user must be authenticated.
  - Appointments must exist in the user's calendar or archive.
  - The application must have the necessary permissions to modify appointments.

## 3. Details

### 3.1. Flow Diagram

```mermaid
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "Archive Calendar" as Archive

User -> UI: Selects OOO period or triggers OOO automation
UI -> BE: Request OOO marking for appointments
BE -> Archive: Identify appointments in OOO period
BE -> Archive: Mark appointments as Out-of-Office
BE -> UI: Show OOO status and confirmation

### 3.2. Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | User/System  | Triggers OOO automation or selects a period.| The system identifies appointments in the OOO period.|
| 2      | Backend      | Identifies the relevant appointments.       | Returns a list of appointments to be marked as OOO.  |
| 3      | Backend      | Marks the appointments as Out-of-Office.    | Updates the appointments in the calendar/archive.    |
| 4      | Backend      | Confirms the update to the UI.              | Shows the OOO status and a confirmation message.     |

### 3.3. Error Scenarios

| Scenario       | Trigger                           | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Save Failure   | A backend or database error occurs. | Shows an error message and allows a retry.      | Retry the save operation. |
| Auth Expired   | The user's session or token has expired. | Prompts the user to re-authenticate.            | Log in again.             |

### 3.4. Design Considerations

- **UI Components**: The interface will include an OOO period selector or an automation trigger button, a status indicator on appointments, and success/error notifications.
- **Accessibility**: All controls will be accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
