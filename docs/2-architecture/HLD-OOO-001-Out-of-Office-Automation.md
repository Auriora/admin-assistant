## Detailed Flow Description

### Entry Points
- User selects an Out-of-Office period or triggers OOO automation (e.g., via dashboard or settings).
- System detects OOO period (e.g., from user profile or external trigger) and initiates automation.

### Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      | UI Elements                | Notes                                  |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1      | User/System  | Triggers OOO automation or selects period   | System identifies appointments in OOO period         | OOO period selector/button | Can be manual or scheduled             |
| 2      | Backend      | Identifies relevant appointments            | Returns list of appointments to be marked OOO        | N/A                        |                                        |
| 3      | Backend      | Marks appointments as Out-of-Office         | Updates appointments in calendar/archive             | N/A                        |                                        |
| 4      | Backend      | Confirms update to UI                       | Shows OOO status and confirmation                   | OOO status indicator        |                                        |
| 5      | User         | Reviews OOO status, can adjust period       | System allows adjustment or re-run                   | OOO period selector/button |                                        |

### Exit Points
- Appointments are marked as Out-of-Office for the selected period.
- User is notified of any errors and can resolve them.
- System logs all actions for audit purposes.

### Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario         | Trigger                                 | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Save Failure          | Backend/database error                   | Shows error, allows retry                       | Retry save                          |
| Auth Expired          | User session/token expired               | Prompts user to re-authenticate                 | Log in again                        |

## UI Components
- OOO period selector or automation trigger button
- OOO status indicator on calendar/appointments
- Success/Error notification banners or modals

## Accessibility Considerations
- All controls accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for OOO indicators and error messages
- Clear, actionable error messages and prompts

## Performance Expectations
- OOO marking should complete within a second for typical data volumes
- UI should remain responsive during backend operations
- System should handle save errors gracefully

## Related Flows
- Appointment Privacy Management (UXF-PRI-001)
- Error Notification Flow (UXF-NOT-001)

## Notes
- All OOO actions and changes are logged for audit and compliance
- Future: Support for multi-user and admin troubleshooting
