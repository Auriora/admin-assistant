# High-Level Design: Location Recommendation and Assignment

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [Developers, UX Designers, Product Managers]

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the high-level design for assisting users in assigning accurate locations to appointments. The objective is to use recommendations from a fixed list, past appointments, or auto-creation from invitations to ensure data completeness and consistency for downstream features like travel calculation.

## 2. Context

- **User Personas**: The primary user is a professional who needs to maintain accurate location data for their appointments.
- **Preconditions**:
  - The user must be authenticated.
  - An appointment must exist with a missing or ambiguous location.

## 3. Details

### 3.1. Flow Diagram

```mermaid
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "Archive Calendar" as Archive
database "Location List" as LocList

User -> UI: Views appointment with missing location
UI -> BE: Request location recommendation
BE -> LocList: Fetch fixed list and past locations
LocList --> BE: Return recommendations
BE -> UI: Show recommended locations
User -> UI: Selects or adds location
UI -> BE: Save location to appointment
BE -> Archive: Update appointment
BE -> LocList: Add new location (if needed)
BE -> UI: Confirm update, show status

### 3.2. Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | User/System  | An appointment with a missing location is detected. | The system prompts the user to assign a location.    |
| 2      | Backend      | Fetches recommended locations.              | Returns a list of recommendations to the UI.         |
| 3      | User         | Selects a recommendation or adds a new one. | Sends the selection to the backend.                  |
| 4      | Backend      | Validates and saves the location.           | Updates the appointment and the location list.       |
| 5      | User         | (If conflict) Resolves the location conflict. | The system prompts the user for resolution.          |

### 3.3. Error Scenarios

| Scenario          | Trigger                                     | System Response                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Location Conflict | A new location conflicts with an existing one.| Prompts the user to resolve the conflict.       |
| Invalid Location  | The user enters an invalid location format. | Shows an error and prevents saving.             |
| Save Failure      | A backend or database error occurs.         | Shows an error message and allows a retry.      |

### 3.4. Design Considerations

- **UI Components**: The UI will include a location field in the appointment details, a recommendation dropdown/list, an "add new" button, and a conflict resolution dialog.
- **Accessibility**: All controls will be fully accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
