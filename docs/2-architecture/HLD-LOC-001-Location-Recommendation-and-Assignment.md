## Detailed Flow Description

### Entry Points

## UI Components
- Appointment details page/modal with location field
- Location recommendation dropdown/list
- Add new location button/field
- Conflict resolution dialog
- Success/Error notification banners or modals

## Accessibility Considerations
- All controls accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for prompts and error indicators
- Clear, actionable error messages and prompts

## Performance Expectations
- Location recommendations should appear within a second
- UI should remain responsive during backend operations
- System should handle errors gracefully
