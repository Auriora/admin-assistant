# High-Level Design: Travel Appointment Addition

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [Developers, UX Designers, Product Managers]

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the high-level design for automatically adding travel appointments to a user's calendar. The objective is to use location data from appointments and the Google Directions API to estimate travel time, creating separate calendar entries for travel. This ensures accurate time tracking for both billing and scheduling purposes.

## 2. Context

- **User Personas**: The primary user is a professional who travels between appointments.
- **Preconditions**:
  - The user must be authenticated.
  - Appointments with different locations must exist in the calendar.
  - The user's "Home" location must be configured in their profile.

## 3. Details

### 3.1. Flow Diagram

```mermaid
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "Archive Calendar" as Archive
participant "Google Directions API" as GAPI

User -> UI: Views calendar or triggers travel calculation
UI -> BE: Request travel appointment addition
BE -> Archive: Fetch appointments and locations
BE -> GAPI: Request travel time between locations
GAPI --> BE: Return travel time (or error)
BE -> Archive: Add travel appointments
BE -> UI: Show travel appointments and status

### 3.2. Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | User/System  | Triggers travel calculation (manually or auto). | The system identifies appointments requiring travel. |
| 2      | Backend      | Fetches appointments and their locations.   | Returns a list of appointment pairs needing travel.  |
| 3      | Backend      | Requests travel time from the Google API.   | Receives the travel time or an error.                |
| 4      | Backend      | Adds travel appointments to the calendar.   | Confirms the addition or surfaces an error.          |
| 5      | Backend      | Returns the result to the UI.               | Displays the new travel appointments and any alerts. |

### 3.3. Error Scenarios

| Scenario              | Trigger                                     | System Response                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| API Quota Exceeded    | The Google Directions API limit is reached. | Notifies the user and skips the calculation.    |
| Route Unreachable     | An invalid source or destination is provided. | Prompts the user to check the locations.        |
| Traffic Data Unavail. | No traffic data is returned from the API.   | Uses the standard travel time and notifies the user. |
| Insufficient Time     | Not enough time exists between appointments.| Alerts the user via email or an in-app notification. |

### 3.4. Design Considerations

- **UI Components**: The calendar view will display the created travel appointments. Error and alert banners will be used to communicate issues.
- **Accessibility**: All controls and indicators will be accessible to screen readers.
- **Performance**: Travel calculations should be fast, and the UI must remain responsive during the process.
