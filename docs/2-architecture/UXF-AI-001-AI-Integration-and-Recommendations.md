## Flow Diagram
```
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
participant "OpenAI API" as AI

User -> UI: Triggers AI-powered action (e.g., categorize)
UI -> BE: Request AI recommendation
BE -> AI: Send sanitized, anonymized data
AI --> BE: Return recommendation
BE -> UI: Show recommendation, allow review/override
User -> UI: Reviews/overrides recommendation
UI -> BE: Save final decision
BE -> UI: Confirm update, show status

## Detailed Flow Description

### Entry Points
- User triggers an AI-powered action (e.g., categorization, rules) from UI
- System automatically triggers AI for relevant flows (if enabled)

### Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      | UI Elements                | Notes                                  |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1      | User/System  | Triggers AI-powered action                  | System prepares and sanitizes data                   | Action button, auto-trigger|                                        |
| 2      | Backend      | Sends data to OpenAI API                    | Receives recommendation or error                     | N/A                        | Data is anonymized, sanitized          |
| 3      | Backend      | Returns recommendation to UI                | Shows recommendation, allows user review/override    | Recommendation field, Accept/Override|                                        |
| 4      | User         | Reviews/overrides recommendation            | Sends final decision to backend                      | Accept/Override buttons     |                                        |
| 5      | Backend      | Saves final decision                        | Confirms update or shows error                       | Success/Error notification  |                                        |

### Exit Points
- User reviews and accepts/overrides AI recommendation
- System logs all actions for audit and compliance
- User is notified of any errors and can retry or seek help

### Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario         | Trigger                                 | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| AI Unavailable        | OpenAI API error/downtime                | Notifies user, allows retry or manual action    | Retry or proceed manually           |
| Privacy Violation     | Data not properly sanitized/anonymized   | Blocks request, logs error                      | User notified, admin reviews        |
| Save Failure          | Backend/database error                   | Shows error, allows retry                       | Retry save                          |
| Auth Expired          | User session/token expired               | Prompts user to re-authenticate                 | Log in again                        |

## UI Components
- Action buttons to trigger AI-powered features
- Recommendation field with Accept/Override
- Success/Error notification banners or modals

## Accessibility Considerations
- All controls accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for recommendations and error messages
- Clear, actionable error messages and prompts

## Performance Expectations
- AI recommendations should appear within a few seconds
- UI should remain responsive during backend operations
- System should handle AI and save errors gracefully

## Related Flows
- Appointment Categorization (UXF-CAT-001)
- Rules and Guidelines Management (UXF-RUL-001)
- Error Notification Flow (UXF-NOT-001)

## Notes
- All AI actions and user decisions are logged for audit and compliance
- Future: Support for multi-user and admin troubleshooting

## Additional Note: Persistent Chat/AI for Overlap Resolution and Beyond

- The persistent chat/AI interface will be used for overlap resolution (see UXF-OVL-001) and other features in future. Chat history is stored for each session, enabling both synchronous and asynchronous user interaction with AI-powered features.
