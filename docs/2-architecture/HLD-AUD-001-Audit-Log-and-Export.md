# High-Level Design: Audit Log and Export

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [Developers, SRE, Compliance]

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the high-level design and user flow for viewing, searching, and exporting audit logs. The objective is to provide a transparent and accessible way to track all critical system actions (e.g., archiving, exports, API calls, errors) to support troubleshooting and compliance.

## 2. Context

- **User Personas**: The primary users are the professional user (for tracking their own data) and administrators or support staff (for troubleshooting and compliance checks).
- **Preconditions**:
  - The user must be authenticated.
  - The user must have the necessary permissions to view audit logs.
  - Audit log data must exist in the system.

## 3. Details

### 3.1. Flow Diagram

```mermaid
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "Audit Log" as Log

User -> UI: Navigates to Audit Log page
UI -> BE: Request audit log data (with filters/search)
BE -> Log: Fetch audit log entries
Log --> BE: Return log data
BE -> UI: Show log entries
User -> UI: Searches/filters/exports log
UI -> BE: Request filtered/exported data
BE -> Log: Fetch/process data
BE -> UI: Provide export/download link

### 3.2. Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor   | Action                            | System Response                                      |
|--------|---------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | User    | Navigates to the Audit Log page.  | Loads and displays audit log entries (paged).        |
| 2      | User    | Searches or filters the log.      | Sends a search/filter request to the backend.        |
| 3      | Backend | Fetches the filtered log data.    | Returns the filtered and paged results to the UI.    |
| 4      | User    | Requests an export of the data.   | Sends an export request to the backend.              |
| 5      | Backend | Processes the export.             | Provides a download link for the generated file.     |

### 3.3. Error Scenarios

| Scenario           | Trigger                           | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Export Failure     | File generation or download error | Shows an error message and allows a retry.      | Retry the export.         |
| Log Fetch Failure  | Backend or database error         | Shows an error message and allows a retry.      | Retry the data fetch.     |
| Auth Expired       | User session or token has expired | Prompts the user to re-authenticate.            | Log in again.             |

### 3.4. Design Considerations

- **UI Components**: The interface will feature an audit log table with controls for paging, searching, and filtering. An export button will be available.
- **Accessibility**: All controls will be accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- **Performance**: Log fetches and exports must be performant, even with large data volumes. The UI must remain responsive.
- **Traceability**: For actions like overlap resolution, audit log entries will reference the associated virtual calendar and AI chat session to ensure full traceability.
