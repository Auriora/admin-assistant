# High-Level Design: Rules and Guidelines Management

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [Developers, UX Designers, Product Managers]

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the high-level design for managing the rules and guidelines that influence system recommendations and automation. The objective is to empower users to view, add, edit, and delete these rules, allowing them to customize the system's behavior to fit their specific needs.

## 2. Context

- **User Personas**: The primary user is a professional who wants to tailor the application's automated suggestions.
- **Preconditions**: The user must be authenticated and have the necessary permissions to access the rules management interface.

## 3. Details

### 3.1. Flow Diagram

```mermaid
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "Rules/Guidelines Base" as Rules
participant "OpenAI API" as AI

User -> UI: Navigates to Rules/Guidelines page
UI -> BE: Request current rules
BE -> Rules: Fetch rules for user
Rules --> BE: Return rules
BE -> UI: Show rules list
User -> UI: Adds/edits/deletes rule
UI -> BE: Save rule changes
BE -> Rules: Update rules base
BE -> AI: (If needed) Update AI context
BE -> UI: Confirm update, show status

### 3.2. Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor   | Action                                      | System Response                                      |
|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | User    | Navigates to the Rules/Guidelines page.     | Loads and displays the current list of rules.        |
| 2      | User    | Adds, edits, or deletes a rule.             | Sends the change request to the backend.             |
| 3      | Backend | Updates the rules base in the database.     | Confirms the update or returns an error.             |
| 4      | Backend | Returns the result to the UI.               | Displays a success or error message.                 |

### 3.3. Error Scenarios

| Scenario          | Trigger                                     | System Response                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Save Failure      | A backend or database error occurs.         | Shows an error message and allows a retry.      |
| AI Update Failure | An error occurs while updating the AI context.| Shows an error message and allows a retry.      |
| Auth Expired      | The user's session or token has expired.    | Prompts the user to re-authenticate.            |

### 3.4. Design Considerations

- **UI Components**: The UI will consist of a rules management page with a list or table of rules and controls for adding, editing, and deleting them.
- **Accessibility**: All controls will be accessible via keyboard and screen readers.
- **Performance**: Rule changes should be reflected immediately. The UI must remain responsive during all backend operations.
