### Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      | UI Elements                | Notes                                  |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|

### Exit Points
- Rules/guidelines are updated and reflected in recommendations/automation.
- User is notified of any errors and can resolve them.
- System logs all actions for audit purposes.

### Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario         | Trigger                                 | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Save Failure          | Backend/database error                   | Shows error, allows retry                       | Retry save                          |
| AI Update Failure     | Error updating AI context                | Shows error, allows retry                       | Retry action                        |
| Auth Expired          | User session/token expired               | Prompts user to re-authenticate                 | Log in again                        |

## UI Components
- Rules/Guidelines management page
- Rules list/table
- Add/Edit/Delete buttons or dialogs
- Success/Error notification banners or modals

## Accessibility Considerations
- All controls accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for controls and error messages
- Clear, actionable error messages and prompts

## Performance Expectations
- Rule changes should be reflected within a second
- UI should remain responsive during backend operations
- System should handle save and AI update errors gracefully

## Related Flows
- Appointment Categorization (UXF-CAT-001)
- Timesheet Generation and Export (UXF-BIL-001)
- Error Notification Flow (UXF-NOT-001)

## Notes
- All rule changes are logged for audit and compliance
- Future: Support for multi-user and admin troubleshooting
