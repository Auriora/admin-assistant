# High-Level Design: Multi-User and Role Provisions

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Proposed
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [Developers, Architects, Product Managers]

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the architectural provisions for future multi-user and role-based access control (RBAC). The objective is to ensure the system is designed for scalability, with strict user data isolation, secure role management, and prevention of unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

## 2. Context

- **User Personas**: This design considers two primary personas: the **Admin**, who manages users and roles, and the standard **User**, who accesses their own data.
- **Preconditions**: The system must be configured for multi-user mode, and all users must be authenticated.

## 3. Details

### 3.1. Flow Diagram

```mermaid
@startuml
actor Admin
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "User/Role DB" as DB

Admin -> UI: Navigates to User/Role Management page
UI -> BE: Request user/role data
BE -> DB: Fetch user/role info
DB --> BE: Return data
BE -> UI: Show user/role list
Admin -> UI: Adds/edits/deletes user or role
UI -> BE: Save changes
BE -> DB: Update user/role info

User -> UI: Logs in, accesses data
UI -> BE: Enforce user/role isolation
BE -> DB: Fetch user-specific data
DB --> BE: Return data
BE -> UI: Show user data

### 3.2. Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor   | Action                                      | System Response                                      |
|--------|---------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Admin   | Navigates to the User/Role Management page. | Loads and displays the list of users and roles.      |
| 2      | Admin   | Adds, edits, or deletes a user or role.     | Sends the change request to the backend.             |
| 3      | Backend | Updates the user/role information in the DB.| Confirms the update or returns an error.             |
| 4      | User    | Logs in and accesses their data.            | The system enforces strict user/role data isolation. |
| 5      | Backend | Fetches data specific to the user.          | Returns only the data the user is authorized to see. |

### 3.3. Error Scenarios

| Scenario              | Trigger                                     | System Response                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Unauthorized Access   | A user attempts to access another user's data. | Access is denied, and the event is logged.      |
| Role Escalation       | A user attempts an unauthorized role change.| The action is denied, and the event is logged.  |
| Save Failure          | A backend or database error occurs.         | An error message is shown, allowing a retry.    |

### 3.4. Design Considerations

- **UI Components**: An admin-only User/Role management page will be required.
- **Data Isolation**: The core of the design is ensuring that all data queries are strictly filtered by `user_id`.
- **Security**: All user and role management actions must be logged for a complete audit trail.
