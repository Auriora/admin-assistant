## AI Implementation Prompts

### Prompt 1: Timesheet Generation Service
```
Create a comprehensive TimesheetGenerationService for the admin-assistant project that:

1. Extracts archived appointments from the database for a specified date range
2. Uses the existing CategoryProcessingService to parse customer and billing information
3. Calculates total hours per customer/billing type combination
4. Generates a PDF timesheet matching the existing template format
5. Excludes private appointments and 'Free' status appointments
6. Includes summary statistics and validation

The service should integrate with the existing architecture using:
- SQLAlchemy models (Appointment, User, Category)
- CategoryProcessingService for category parsing
- AuditLogService for operation logging
- Existing error handling patterns

Include comprehensive error handling, logging, and unit tests.
```

### Prompt 2: Travel Detection Service
```
Create a TravelDetectionService for the admin-assistant project that:

1. Analyzes sequences of appointments to detect location changes
2. Integrates with Google Directions API for travel time calculation
3. Identifies missing travel appointments between different locations
4. Handles special cases like 'Online' appointments (no travel needed)
5. Auto-marks Out-of-Office status for travel to non-Home/Office locations

The service should work with the existing appointment model and integrate with:
- Location model for location management
- Privacy automation for OOO status
- Existing MS Graph integration
- Audit logging for all operations

Include comprehensive error handling, API rate limiting, and unit tests.
```

### Prompt 3: Xero Integration Service
```
Create a XeroIntegrationService for the admin-assistant project that:

1. Integrates with Xero API for invoice creation and management
2. Maps timesheet data to Xero invoice format with line items
3. Attaches PDF timesheets to invoices
4. Tracks invoice status and payment information
5. Handles API errors, retries, and rate limiting

The service should integrate with:
- TimesheetGenerationService for PDF creation
- Existing audit logging system
- User model for customer/billing information
- Error handling and notification patterns

Include comprehensive error handling, retry logic, and unit tests.
```
