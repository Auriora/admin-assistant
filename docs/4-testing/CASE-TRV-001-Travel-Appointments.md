# Test Case: Travel Appointment Calculation and Addition

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Draft
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [QA Team, Developers]
- **Related Requirements**: FR-TRV-001, FR-TRV-003, FR-TRV-004, FR-TRV-005, FR-TRV-006, FR-TRV-007, FR-TRV-008, NFR-PERF-001, NFR-REL-001

## 1. Purpose

Verify that the system accurately calculates travel needs, adds travel appointments using the Google Directions API, handles exceptions (e.g., unreachable routes, API limits, unavailable traffic data), and notifies the user of any issues. This test case ensures accurate travel time tracking for billing and scheduling.

## 2. Preconditions

-   The user is authenticated.
-   At least two appointments with different locations are scheduled in the user's calendar.
-   The user's profile has a "Home" location configured.
-   The system has access to the Google Directions API.

## 3. Test Data

-   **Scenario 1 (Normal)**: Two consecutive appointments with distinct, valid physical addresses.
-   **Scenario 2 (Unreachable Route)**: Two appointments where the route between them is geographically impossible or restricted.
-   **Scenario 3 (API Limit)**: Configuration to simulate Google Directions API quota being exceeded.
-   **Scenario 4 (No Traffic Data)**: Appointments scheduled during a time when traffic data is typically unavailable.
-   **Scenario 5 (Insufficient Travel Time)**: Two back-to-back appointments with minimal time between them, making travel impossible within the gap.

## 4. Test Steps

| Step # | Description                                       | Expected Result                                                              |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | Trigger travel calculation for Scenario 1.        | Travel appointments are correctly added to the calendar with accurate times. |
| 2      | Trigger travel calculation for Scenario 2.        | The user is prompted to check the source/destination for the unreachable route. |
| 3      | Trigger travel calculation for Scenario 3.        | The user is notified of the API quota/limit being exceeded, and the system handles retries if applicable. |
| 4      | Trigger travel calculation for Scenario 4.        | The system uses standard travel time (without traffic predictions) and notifies the user if traffic data was unavailable. |
| 5      | Trigger travel calculation for Scenario 5.        | The user is alerted (e.g., via email or in-app notification) about insufficient travel time between appointments. |

## 5. Post-conditions

-   Travel appointments are added to the calendar where applicable.
-   The user is notified of any issues (unreachable routes, API limits, insufficient travel time).
-   All travel calculation actions are logged for audit purposes.

## 6. Special Requirements

-   The system should attempt to use traffic predictions from the Google Directions API when available.
-   Notifications for insufficient travel time should be prominent and actionable.

## 7. Dependencies

-   Google Directions API integration.
-   Calendar Service for adding/managing appointments.
-   Notification Service for user alerts.

## 8. Notes

-   Ensure that travel appointments are correctly categorized and marked as Out-of-Office if applicable.
-   Verify that multi-day trips and other exceptions are handled as per requirements.
