# Test Plan: Admin Assistant Test Plan

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Approved
- **Created Date**: 2024-12-19
- **Last Updated**: 2024-12-19
- **Audience**: [QA Team, Developers, Project Managers, Stakeholders]
- **Scope**: Entire Admin Assistant project

## 1. Purpose

This test plan outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the Admin Assistant project. It covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing scenarios, reflecting the current implementation using the pytest framework with a target of 95%+ test coverage. The primary objectives are to ensure the quality, reliability, and correctness of all implemented features.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1. In-Scope

-   Core services (`core/services/`)
-   Repository layer (`core/repositories/`)
-   Orchestration layer (`core/orchestrators/`)
-   Database models (`core/models/`)
-   Web interface routes (`web/app/routes/`)
-   CLI commands and utilities
-   Integration with Microsoft Graph API
-   Background job processing
-   Audit logging and observability features

### 2.2. Out-of-Scope

-   Third-party libraries and dependencies (testing focuses on their integration, not internal functionality)
-   Performance and load testing (will be covered by a separate plan if required)
-   External API availability testing (assumed external services are operational)
-   Production environment testing (testing is conducted in dedicated test environments)

## 3. Test Items

The software items to be tested include the entire Admin Assistant application codebase, specifically:

-   **Core Services**: `CalendarArchiveService`, `CategoryProcessingService`, `EnhancedOverlapResolutionService`, `MeetingModificationService`, `PrivacyAutomationService`, `ArchiveConfigurationService`.
-   **Repository Layer**: `MSGraphAppointmentRepository`, `SQLAlchemyAppointmentRepository`, `CategoryRepository`, `ArchiveConfigurationRepository`.
-   **Orchestration Layer**: `CalendarArchiveOrchestrator`, `ArchiveJobRunner`.
-   **CLI Commands**: All commands defined in `cli/main.py`.
-   **Web Interface**: Authentication flow, calendar management, manual archive triggers, configuration management.

## 4. Features to be Tested

-   Achieve and maintain 95%+ test coverage for all implemented features.
-   Ensure robust error handling and exception management across the application.
-   Validate Microsoft Graph API integration, primarily through comprehensive mocking.
-   Verify calendar archiving workflows and data integrity.
-   Test background job processing and scheduling mechanisms.
-   Validate audit logging and observability features.

## 5. Features Not to be Tested

As detailed in Section 2.2 (Out-of-Scope), the following features will explicitly not be tested as part of this plan:

-   Internal functionality of third-party libraries and dependencies.
-   Comprehensive performance and load characteristics.
-   The inherent availability of external APIs (e.g., Microsoft Graph, Google Directions).
-   Direct testing within the production environment.

## 6. Testing Approach

### 6.1. Test Levels

-   **Unit Testing**: Focuses on individual service and repository methods, models, and utilities to ensure their isolated correctness.
-   **Integration Testing**: Verifies the interaction between different components and services, including end-to-end workflow testing for core functionalities.

### 6.2. Test Types

-   **Functional Testing**: Validating that all features meet specified requirements.
-   **Regression Testing**: Ensuring new changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.
-   **API Integration Testing**: Verifying correct interaction with external APIs (primarily mocked).
-   **Database Testing**: Validating SQLAlchemy models and repository interactions with the database.
-   **CLI Testing**: Ensuring command-line interface commands function as expected.
-   **Error Scenario Testing**: Verifying robust exception handling and recovery mechanisms.

### 6.3. Test Strategy

Testing will be conducted using `pytest` as the primary framework, leveraging markers for categorization (unit, integration, slow, msgraph, db). `pytest-cov` will enforce an 80% minimum code coverage, with a target of 95% for all implemented features. External API integrations will be thoroughly mocked using `pytest-mock` and `unittest.mock` to ensure isolated and repeatable tests. An in-memory SQLite database will be used for database testing to maintain test isolation.

## 7. Roles and Responsibilities

-   **QA Lead**: Oversees the testing process, defines strategies, and ensures quality gates are met.
-   **Test Engineers**: Develop, execute, and maintain test cases; report defects.
-   **Developers**: Write unit tests, assist with integration testing, and fix reported defects.
-   **Project Manager**: Monitors testing progress and ensures alignment with project timelines.

## 8. Entry Criteria

-   All in-scope features have completed development and initial unit testing.
-   Code freeze for the current iteration/release.
-   Test environment is set up and stable.
-   All critical defects from previous testing cycles are resolved or have approved deferrals.
-   Test data is prepared and available.

## 9. Exit Criteria

-   All high-priority test cases (P1, P2) have passed.
-   Achieved minimum 80% code coverage, with a target of 95% for new features.
-   All critical and major defects are resolved or have approved deferrals.
-   No open blocking or critical issues.
-   Test summary report is generated and reviewed.

## 10. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements

-   **Suspension**: Testing will be suspended if a blocking defect is found that prevents further testing, or if the test environment becomes unstable.
-   **Resumption**: Testing will resume once the blocking defect is resolved and verified, or the test environment is restored to a stable state.

## 11. Test Environment

-   **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu/compatible) for consistency.
-   **Python Version**: 3.12.x, managed within a virtual environment (`.venv/`).
-   **Database**: In-memory SQLite database for test isolation and speed.
-   **Dependencies**: All project and testing dependencies as specified in `requirements.txt`.
-   **Configuration**: Test-specific environment variables to ensure isolated execution.
-   **Execution**: Primarily via JetBrains run configurations (`.run/` directory) and command-line scripts.

## 12. Schedule and Resources

-   **Schedule**: Testing activities will be integrated throughout the development lifecycle, with dedicated cycles for integration and system testing prior to releases.
-   **Human Resources**: QA Lead, Test Engineers, and Development Team members (for unit testing and defect resolution).
-   **Tool Resources**: Pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock, pytest-asyncio, SQLAlchemy, unittest.mock, OpenTelemetry.

## 13. Risks and Contingencies

| Risk                       | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                                 |
|----------------------------|------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft Graph API changes| Medium     | High   | Comprehensive mocking, continuous API version monitoring, integration tests. |
| Test data corruption       | Low        | Medium | Use of in-memory database, isolated test sessions, automated test data setup. |
| Environment inconsistency  | Low        | Medium | Use of virtual environments, standardized dependencies, Docker for consistency. |
| Test execution time        | Medium     | Low    | Parallel test execution, optimized test structure, focus on unit tests.    |
