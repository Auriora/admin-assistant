# Test Plan

## Project Information
- **Project Name**: Admin Assistant
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Author**: [Your Name]

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
This test plan outlines the approach, scope, resources, and schedule for testing the Admin Assistant project. The goal is to ensure the application meets its requirements and functions reliably for end users.

### 1.2 Scope
- **In Scope**:  
  - API endpoints and route handlers in `app/routes/`
  - Service logic in `app/services/`
  - Integration with external APIs (e.g., Microsoft Graph, Xero)
  - Database interactions via SQLAlchemy
  - Frontend static assets and templates in `app/static/` and `app/templates/`
- **Out of Scope**:  
  - Third-party libraries and dependencies
  - Performance and load testing (unless specified)
  - Non-functional requirements not explicitly stated in requirements

### 1.3 References
- `docs/1-requirements/`
- `docs/2-design/`
- `docs/3-implementation/`
- `docs/4-testing/`
- `requirements.txt`
- [Any additional specifications or user stories]

## 2. Test Strategy
### 2.1 Testing Objectives
- Verify all features meet functional requirements
- Ensure integration with external services works as expected
- Validate data integrity and error handling
- Confirm UI renders correctly and is usable

### 2.2 Testing Types
- Unit Testing (services, utility functions)
- Integration Testing (routes, database, external APIs)
- Functional Testing (end-to-end user scenarios)
- Regression Testing (after changes)
- Manual Exploratory Testing (UI and edge cases)

### 2.3 Testing Tools
- **pytest** (unit and integration tests)
- **Flask test client** (API/route testing)
- **Coverage.py** (test coverage reporting)
- **Mocking libraries** (e.g., unittest.mock)
- [Browser for manual UI testing]

### 2.4 Testing Environment
- OS: Linux (6.11.0-26-generic) or compatible
- Python 3.12.x virtual environment (`.venv/`)
- Required dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- Test/staging database (separate from production)
- Access to external APIs (with test credentials if possible)

## 3. Test Items
- User authentication and authorization flows
- CRUD operations for main entities (as defined in requirements)
- Integration with Microsoft Graph and Xero APIs
- Error handling and validation
- Static file serving and template rendering

## 4. Testing Schedule
- **Phase 1: Test Plan Review**: Completed before development begins
- **Phase 2: Unit Test Development**: Begins with initial code implementation, duration of 3-5 days
- **Phase 3: Integration Testing**: Follows unit test completion, duration of 2-3 days
- **Phase 4: Functional/Manual Testing**: After integration tests are complete, duration of 2-3 days
- **Phase 5: Regression Testing**: Ongoing after each major feature or bug fix
- **Phase 6: Test Completion/Sign-off**: After all features are implemented and tested

## 5. Resource Requirements
- pytest and coverage reporting tools
- Docker for containerized test environments
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- Test/staging server or local environment
- Test accounts and credentials for Microsoft Graph and Xero APIs

## 6. Risk Assessment
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| External API downtime | Medium | High | Use mocks/stubs for testing, schedule tests during API uptime |
| Incomplete requirements | Medium | Medium | Clarify requirements before test case development |
| Environment mismatch | Low | Medium | Use containerization or scripts to standardize environments |
| Data loss in test DB | Low | High | Use backups and non-production data for testing |

## 7. Test Deliverables
- Test plan document
- Test cases/scripts
- Test execution reports
- Defect/bug reports
- Test summary report

## 8. Approval
[Sign-off by Project Manager, QA Lead, or other stakeholders]
