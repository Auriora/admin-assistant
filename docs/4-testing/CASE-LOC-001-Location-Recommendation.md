# Test Case: Location Recommendation and Assignment

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Draft
- **Created Date**: 2024-06-11
- **Last Updated**: 2024-06-11
- **Audience**: [QA Team, Developers]
- **Related Requirements**: FR-LOC-001, FR-LOC-002, FR-LOC-003, FR-LOC-004, NFR-USE-001

## 1. Purpose

Verify that the system recommends a location for appointments missing one, allows the user to add or confirm locations, and handles conflicts or ambiguities appropriately. This test case ensures data completeness and consistency for downstream features like travel calculation.

## 2. Preconditions

-   The user is authenticated.
-   An appointment exists in the user's calendar without a specified location.
-   A list of known locations is configured in the system.

## 3. Test Data

-   **Scenario 1 (Missing Location)**: An appointment with no location specified.
-   **Scenario 2 (Conflicting Location)**: An attempt to add a new location that is very similar to an existing one, potentially causing a conflict.
-   **Scenario 3 (Ambiguous Location)**: An appointment description that could refer to multiple known locations or no clear location.

## 4. Test Steps

| Step # | Description                                       | Expected Result                                                              |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | View an appointment from Scenario 1.              | The system recommends a location based on a fixed list or past data.         |
| 2      | User selects a recommended location or adds a new one. | The chosen location is successfully assigned to the appointment.             |
| 3      | Attempt to add a new location from Scenario 2.    | The system detects a potential conflict and prompts the user to resolve it.  |
| 4      | View an appointment from Scenario 3.              | The system indicates it cannot determine a location and prompts the user for manual input. |

## 5. Post-conditions

-   The appointment has a valid location assigned.
-   The user is notified of any conflicts or ambiguities and can resolve them.
-   All location assignment actions are logged for audit purposes.

## 6. Special Requirements

-   The user must be able to configure and manage their list of known locations.
-   The recommendation engine should prioritize fixed lists over historical data.

## 7. Dependencies

-   Location Recommendation Service.
-   User Profile Service (for Home location and configured lists).
-   Notification Service (for user prompts).

## 8. Notes

-   Test both automatic recommendation and manual input flows.
-   Verify that auto-creation of locations from invitations works correctly.
