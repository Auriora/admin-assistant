## Detailed Flow Description

### Entry Points

- User receives notification via in-app banner, modal, or email.

### Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      | UI Elements                | Notes                                  |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1      | System       | Detects issue (missing/conflicting data)    | Triggers notification via configured channels        | N/A                        | Can be in-app, email, or both          |
| 2      | Notification | Sends notification to user                  | User receives notification                           | Notification banner/email   |                                        |
| 3      | User         | Views notification, takes action            | System logs user action/response                     | Notification panel, links   |                                        |
| 4      | System       | Logs notification and user response         | Updates audit log                                    | N/A                        |                                        |

### Exit Points
- User is notified of the issue and can take corrective action.
- System logs all notifications and user responses for audit purposes.

### Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario         | Trigger                                 | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Notification Failure  | Email/in-app notification fails          | Logs error, retries or uses fallback channel    | User may not receive notification   |
| Auth Expired          | User session/token expired               | Prompts user to re-authenticate                 | Log in again                        |

## UI Components
- Notification banners, modals, or panel in-app
- Email notification template
- Notification settings/configuration page

## Accessibility Considerations
- All notifications accessible via screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for notification banners
- Clear, actionable notification content

## Performance Expectations
- Notifications should be delivered within a few seconds of issue detection
- UI should remain responsive during notification delivery
- System should handle notification errors gracefully

## Related Flows
- All flows that may generate user-facing issues (e.g., archiving, export, travel, etc.)
- Error Notification Flow (self-referential)

## Notes
- All notifications and user responses are logged for audit and compliance
- Future: Support for multi-user and admin troubleshooting
