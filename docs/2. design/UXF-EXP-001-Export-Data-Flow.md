## Flow Diagram
```
@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "Archive/Export Data" as Data

User -> UI: Navigates to Export page or triggers export
UI -> BE: Request export (selects format, date range, etc.)
BE -> Data: Fetch data for export
BE -> BE: Generate file in selected format
BE -> UI: Provide download link or file
User -> UI: Downloads file

## Detailed Flow Description

### Entry Points
- User navigates to the Export page or triggers export from another flow (e.g., timesheet, audit log).

### Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      | UI Elements                | Notes                                  |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1      | User         | Navigates to Export page or triggers export | Loads export options (formats, date range, etc.)     | Export page, options       |                                        |
| 2      | User         | Selects format, date range, clicks Export   | Sends export request to backend                      | Format selector, Export button|                                        |
| 3      | Backend      | Fetches data for export                     | Returns data or error                                | N/A                        |                                        |
| 4      | Backend      | Generates file in selected format           | Provides download link or file                       | Download link               | Handles special characters, large data |
| 5      | User         | Downloads file                              | System logs export action                            | Download button             |                                        |

### Exit Points
- User downloads exported file in desired format.
- User is notified of any errors and can retry or seek help.
- System logs all export actions for audit purposes.

### Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario         | Trigger                                 | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Export Failure        | File generation or download error        | Shows error, allows retry                       | Retry export                        |
| Data Fetch Failure    | Backend/database error                   | Shows error, allows retry                       | Retry fetch                         |
| Auth Expired          | User session/token expired               | Prompts user to re-authenticate                 | Log in again                        |

## UI Components
- Export page with format selector, date range picker, and export button
- Download link/button
- Success/Error notification banners or modals

## Accessibility Considerations
- All controls accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for controls and error messages
- Clear, actionable error messages and prompts

## Performance Expectations
- Exports should complete within a few seconds for typical data volumes
- UI should remain responsive during backend operations
- System should handle fetch and export errors gracefully

## Related Flows
- Timesheet Generation and Export (UXF-BIL-001)
- Audit Log and Export (UXF-AUD-001)
- Error Notification Flow (UXF-NOT-001)

## Notes
- All export actions are logged for audit and compliance
- Future: Support for multi-user and admin troubleshooting
