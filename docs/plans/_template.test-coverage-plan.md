# Plan: Test Coverage Improvement

- **Owner**: {{owner}}
- **Status**: Draft
- **Created Date**: DD-MM-YYYY
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-19
- **Audience**: Development Team, QA Team

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines a plan to improve test coverage for the project.

## 2. Problem Statement

The current test coverage is below the desired threshold, leading to potential undetected bugs and reduced confidence in code changes. The goal is to increase coverage to {{target_coverage_percent}}% by {{target_date}}, prioritizing critical modules and public APIs for early coverage gains.

## 3. Proposed Solution

### Strategy
- Start with unit tests for library/core modules, then add integration tests for end-to-end flows.
- Add smoke/regression tests for high-risk areas and any reported bugs.
- Use coverage reports to drive task prioritisation (module-level deficits first).

### Milestones
- M1: Baseline coverage and gap analysis (by {{m1_date}})
- M2: Add unit tests for top 5 uncovered modules (by {{m2_date}})
- M3: CI gating for coverage on pull requests (by {{m3_date}})
- M4: Achieve target coverage and stabilise test flakiness (by {{target_date}})

### Tasks (template items)
- Run baseline coverage and produce `COVERAGE_REPORT.md`. Owner: @owner1. Due: {{m1_date}}
- Identify top 10 modules by uncovered lines and create test tasks. Owner: @owner2. Due: {{m2_date}}
- Add missing unit tests (list of PRs linked here). Owner(s): @dev-team.
- Add integration tests for key flows (auth, data import/export). Owner: @qa-team.
- Configure CI to publish coverage artifact and fail PRs under X% (value: {{ci_threshold}}%).
- Track flaky tests and quarantine or fix them; create a `tests/FLAKY.md` and mark quarantined tests.

## 4. Alternatives

[List other options considered and why they were not chosen.]

## 5. Impact

### Risks & Mitigations
- Large legacy modules with complex dependencies: mitigate by adding targeted unit tests and using mocking.
- Flaky tests: add retry logic, isolate environment issues, or quarantine flaky tests until fixed.

## 6. Decision Log

[Record approvals or follow-up actions.]

# References

### Tracking
- Metrics dashboard link: {{coverage_dashboard_url}} (replace with CI or coverage tool link)
- Baseline metrics to record:
  - Overall coverage %
  - Lines/Branches coverage by module
  - Number of tests, test duration, and flakiness rate

### Notes
- Replace all `{{...}}` placeholders with actual values from the project's planning tools or CI.
- Keep this plan under review each sprint; update `last_reviewed` when milestones change.
