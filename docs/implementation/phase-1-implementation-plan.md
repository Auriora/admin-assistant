## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Category Processing Service

#### 1.1 Create CategoryProcessingService
**File**: `core/services/category_processing_service.py`

```python
class CategoryProcessingService:
    """Service for processing Outlook categories according to workflow format."""
    
    def parse_outlook_category(self, category_string: str) -> Tuple[Optional[str], Optional[str]]:
        """
        Parse category string in format '<customer name> - <billing type>'
        Returns: (customer_name, billing_type) or (None, None) if invalid
        """
    
    def validate_category_format(self, categories: List[str]) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
        """
        Validate list of categories and return validation results
        Returns: {'valid': [...], 'invalid': [...], 'issues': [...]}
        """
    
    def extract_customer_billing_info(self, appointment: Appointment) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Extract customer and billing information from appointment
        Returns: {'customer': str, 'billing_type': str, 'is_valid': bool, 'issues': []}
        """
    
    def is_special_category(self, category: str) -> bool:
        """Check if category is special (Admin, Break, Online)"""
    
    def should_mark_private(self, appointment: Appointment) -> bool:
        """Determine if appointment should be marked as private"""
```

#### 1.2 Unit Tests
**File**: `tests/unit/services/test_category_processing_service.py`

Test cases:
- Valid category formats: `"Acme Corp - billable"`, `"Client XYZ - non-billable"`
- Invalid formats: `"Invalid Category"`, `"Too - Many - Dashes"`
- Special categories: `"Admin - non-billable"`, `"Online"`, `"Break - non-billable"`
- Edge cases: Empty strings, None values, multiple categories

#### 1.3 Integration Points
- Update `CalendarArchiveOrchestrator` to use category processing
- Add category validation to archiving workflow
- Log category issues for user review

### Task 2: Enhanced Overlap Resolution Service

#### 2.1 Create EnhancedOverlapResolutionService
**File**: `core/services/enhanced_overlap_resolution_service.py`

```python
class EnhancedOverlapResolutionService:
    """Enhanced overlap resolution with automatic rules."""
    
    def apply_automatic_resolution_rules(self, overlapping_appointments: List[Appointment]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Apply automatic resolution rules in order:
        1. Filter out 'Free' appointments
        2. Discard 'Tentative' in favor of confirmed
        3. Use Priority (importance) for final resolution
        Returns: {'resolved': [...], 'conflicts': [...], 'filtered': [...]}
        """
    
    def filter_free_appointments(self, appointments: List[Appointment]) -> Tuple[List[Appointment], List[Appointment]]:
        """Separate Free appointments from others"""
    
    def resolve_tentative_conflicts(self, appointments: List[Appointment]) -> Tuple[List[Appointment], List[Appointment]]:
        """Resolve Tentative vs Confirmed conflicts"""
    
    def resolve_by_priority(self, appointments: List[Appointment]) -> Tuple[Appointment, List[Appointment]]:
        """Resolve remaining conflicts using importance/priority"""
    
    def get_appointment_priority_score(self, appointment: Appointment) -> int:
        """Calculate priority score for appointment (High=3, Normal=2, Low=1)"""
```

#### 2.2 Update calendar_overlap_utility.py
Enhance existing overlap detection to work with new resolution service:

```python
def detect_overlaps_with_metadata(appointments: List[Appointment]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Enhanced overlap detection that includes metadata for resolution
    Returns list of overlap groups with resolution metadata
    """
```

#### 2.3 Unit Tests
**File**: `tests/unit/services/test_enhanced_overlap_resolution_service.py`

Test scenarios:
- Free appointments filtered out
- Tentative discarded for confirmed
- Priority-based resolution (High > Normal > Low)
- Complex multi-appointment overlaps
- Edge cases with missing show_as or importance

### Task 3: Meeting Modification Processor

#### 3.1 Create MeetingModificationService
**File**: `core/services/meeting_modification_service.py`

```python
class MeetingModificationService:
    """Service for processing meeting modification appointments."""
    
    def detect_modification_type(self, subject: str) -> Optional[str]:
        """
        Detect modification type from subject
        Returns: 'extension', 'shortened', 'early_start', 'late_start', or None
        """
    
    def process_modifications(self, appointments: List[Appointment]) -> List[Appointment]:
        """
        Process all modifications and merge with original appointments
        Returns: List of processed appointments with modifications applied
        """
    
    def merge_extension(self, original: Appointment, extension: Appointment) -> Appointment:
        """Merge extension appointment with original"""
    
    def apply_shortening(self, original: Appointment, shortening: Appointment) -> Appointment:
        """Apply shortening to original appointment"""
    
    def adjust_start_time(self, original: Appointment, timing_adjustment: Appointment) -> Appointment:
        """Adjust start time for early/late start"""
    
    def find_original_appointment(self, modification: Appointment, appointments: List[Appointment]) -> Optional[Appointment]:
        """Find the original appointment for a modification"""
```

#### 3.2 Unit Tests
**File**: `tests/unit/services/test_meeting_modification_service.py`

Test scenarios:
- Extension: 30-minute meeting extended by 15 minutes
- Shortening: 60-minute meeting shortened by 20 minutes  
- Early start: Meeting starts 10 minutes early
- Late start: Meeting starts 15 minutes late
- Multiple modifications on same appointment
- Orphaned modifications (no original found)

### Task 4: Privacy Automation Service

#### 4.1 Create PrivacyAutomationService
**File**: `core/services/privacy_automation_service.py`

```python
class PrivacyAutomationService:
    """Service for automated privacy flag management."""
    
    def should_mark_private(self, appointment: Appointment) -> bool:
        """Determine if appointment should be marked as private"""
    
    def apply_privacy_rules(self, appointments: List[Appointment]) -> List[Appointment]:
        """Apply privacy rules to list of appointments"""
    
    def is_personal_appointment(self, appointment: Appointment) -> bool:
        """Check if appointment is personal (no customer category)"""
    
    def update_privacy_flags(self, appointments: List[Appointment]) -> Dict[str, int]:
        """Update privacy flags and return statistics"""
```

#### 4.2 Unit Tests
**File**: `tests/unit/services/test_privacy_automation_service.py`

Test scenarios:
- Personal appointments (no category) marked as private
- Work appointments (with customer category) not marked as private
- Special categories (Admin, Break) handling
- Existing privacy flags preserved

### Task 5: Integration with CalendarArchiveOrchestrator

#### 5.1 Update CalendarArchiveOrchestrator
**File**: `core/orchestrators/calendar_archive_orchestrator.py`

Add new processing steps:

```python
def archive_user_appointments(self, ...):
    # ... existing code ...
    
    # New processing steps
    category_service = CategoryProcessingService()
    overlap_service = EnhancedOverlapResolutionService()
    modification_service = MeetingModificationService()
    privacy_service = PrivacyAutomationService()
    
    # 1. Process categories and validate
    category_results = category_service.validate_category_format([...])
    
    # 2. Apply privacy automation
    appointments = privacy_service.apply_privacy_rules(appointments)
    
    # 3. Process meeting modifications
    appointments = modification_service.process_modifications(appointments)
    
    # 4. Enhanced overlap resolution
    overlap_results = overlap_service.apply_automatic_resolution_rules(overlaps)
    
    # ... continue with archiving ...
```

#### 5.2 Update Archive Processing Rules
Implement the documented archive processing rules:
1. Filter appointments (exclude 'Free')
2. Resolve overlaps (Free → Tentative → Priority)
3. Merge extensions with original appointments
4. Subtract shortened time from original appointments
5. Adjust start times for early/late starts

### Task 6: CLI Enhancements

#### 6.1 Add Category Validation Command
**File**: `cli/main.py`

```python
@calendar_app.command("validate-categories")
def validate_categories(
    user_id: int = user_id_option,
    start_date: str = typer.Option(None, help="Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)"),
    end_date: str = typer.Option(None, help="End date (YYYY-MM-DD)")
):
    """Validate appointment categories for a user and date range."""
```

#### 6.2 Add Overlap Analysis Command
```python
@calendar_app.command("analyze-overlaps")
def analyze_overlaps(
    user_id: int = user_id_option,
    start_date: str = typer.Option(None, help="Start date (YYYY-MM-DD)"),
    end_date: str = typer.Option(None, help="End date (YYYY-MM-DD)"),
    auto_resolve: bool = typer.Option(False, help="Apply automatic resolution rules")
):
    """Analyze overlapping appointments and optionally auto-resolve."""
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- **Coverage Target**: 95%+ for all new services
- **Test Data**: Create realistic appointment data matching workflow scenarios
- **Edge Cases**: Handle malformed data, missing fields, edge cases

### Integration Testing
- **End-to-End**: Test complete archiving workflow with new services
- **MS Graph Integration**: Test with real Outlook data
- **Performance**: Ensure processing doesn't significantly slow archiving

### User Acceptance Testing
- **Real Data**: Test with your actual Outlook appointments
- **Workflow Validation**: Verify all documented workflow rules work correctly
- **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and user notifications

## Deployment Plan

### Development Environment
1. Create feature branch: `feature/phase-1-core-workflow`
2. Implement services incrementally
3. Add comprehensive unit tests
4. Integration testing with sample data

### Testing Environment
1. Deploy to testing environment
2. Test with real Outlook data
3. Validate workflow rules
4. Performance testing

### Production Deployment
1. Code review and approval
2. Database migration (if needed)
3. Gradual rollout with monitoring
4. User training and documentation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] All unit tests pass with 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Integration tests pass with real Outlook data
- [ ] Performance impact <10% increase in archiving time
- [ ] Zero data loss or corruption

### Business Metrics
- [ ] 95%+ of categories parsed correctly
- [ ] 90%+ of overlaps resolved automatically
