# Generic Appointment Restoration Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully converted the appointment restoration scripts to a generic, configurable feature that can restore from multiple sources (audit logs, backup calendars, export files) to multiple destinations (local calendars, MSGraph calendars, export files).

  - Integration with restoration service for complete backup/restore workflow

### CLI Tools
- **`scripts/appointment_restoration_cli.py`** - Unified CLI replacing individual scripts
  - `audit-logs` command - restore from audit logs
  - `backup-calendars` command - restore from backup calendars  
  - `backup` command - backup calendars to files or other calendars
  - `list-configs` command - list restoration configurations
  - Comprehensive help and examples

### Database Migration
- **`scripts/create_restoration_tables.py`** - Database setup script
  - Creates `restoration_configurations` table
  - Adds sample configurations for testing
  - Verifies table creation and relationships

### Testing
- **`scripts/test_restoration_service.py`** - Test script for validation
  - Tests all major service functionality in dry-run mode
  - Validates configuration creation and management
  - Tests both restoration and backup services

### Documentation
- **`docs/user-guides/appointment-restoration-guide.md`** - Comprehensive user guide
  - Quick start instructions
  - Complete CLI reference with examples
  - Programmatic usage examples
  - Migration guide from old scripts
  - Configuration reference and troubleshooting

### Model Updates
- **`src/core/models/user.py`** - Added restoration_configurations relationship

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multiple Source Types
- **Audit Logs**: Extract failed appointments from audit log entries
- **Backup Calendars**: Restore from existing local calendars
- **Export Files**: Import from CSV, JSON, or ICS files

### 2. Multiple Destination Types  
- **Local Calendars**: Restore to SQLite-based calendars
- **MSGraph Calendars**: Restore to Microsoft 365 calendars
- **Export Files**: Export to various file formats

### 3. Configurable Restoration Policies
- **Duplicate Detection**: Skip appointments that already exist
- **Date Range Filtering**: Limit restoration to specific date ranges
- **Subject Filtering**: Include/exclude based on appointment subjects
- **Category Filtering**: Include/exclude based on appointment categories

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Logging
- All restoration operations are logged for compliance
- Supports reversible operations as per existing audit requirements
- Detailed operation metadata and error tracking

### 5. Backward Compatibility
- Old scripts can still be used (though deprecated)
- New CLI provides equivalent functionality with more flexibility
- Existing audit logs and backup calendars work with new system

## Usage Examples

### Quick Restoration from Audit Logs
```bash
# Dry run to see what would be restored
python scripts/appointment_restoration_cli.py audit-logs --dry-run

# Restore failed appointments from specific date range
python scripts/appointment_restoration_cli.py audit-logs \
  --start-date 2025-05-29 --end-date 2025-06-06
```

### Restore from Backup Calendars
```bash
# Consolidate multiple backup calendars
python scripts/appointment_restoration_cli.py backup-calendars \
  --source-calendars "Recovered" "Recovered Missing" \
  --destination-calendar "Consolidated Recovery"
```

### Create Calendar Backups
```bash
# Backup to CSV file
python scripts/appointment_restoration_cli.py backup \
  --source-calendar "Main Calendar" \
  --backup-destination "backup.csv" \
  --backup-format csv
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from core.services.appointment_restoration_service import AppointmentRestorationService

service = AppointmentRestorationService(user_id=1)

# Restore from audit logs
result = service.restore_from_audit_logs(
    start_date=date(2025, 5, 29),
    end_date=date(2025, 6, 6),
    destination_calendar="Recovered"
)

print(f"Restored {result['restored']} appointments")
```

## Migration from Old Scripts

| Old Script | New Command | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| `restore_lost_appointments.py` | `audit-logs` | Direct replacement with more options |
| `restore_missing_appointments.py` | `audit-logs` | Use custom date ranges |
| `restore_to_msgraph_recovery.py` | `backup-calendars` | With MSGraph destination |
| `export_appointments_for_msgraph.py` | `backup` | With appropriate format |

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create Database Tables**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/create_restoration_tables.py
   ```

2. **Test the Implementation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/test_restoration_service.py
   ```

3. **List Available Configurations**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/appointment_restoration_cli.py list-configs
   ```

4. **Try a Dry Run Restoration**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/appointment_restoration_cli.py audit-logs --dry-run
   ```

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Unified Interface**: Single CLI tool replaces multiple scripts
2. **Configurable**: Flexible policies for different restoration scenarios
3. **Extensible**: Easy to add new source and destination types
4. **Auditable**: Comprehensive logging for all operations
5. **Testable**: Dry-run capabilities for safe testing
6. **Future-Ready**: Built-in backup service for proactive data protection

## Future Enhancements

The new architecture supports easy addition of:
- New source types (Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.)
- New destination types (cloud storage, other calendar systems)
- Advanced restoration policies (AI-based duplicate detection, etc.)
- Scheduled backup operations
- Web UI for configuration management

## Compliance and Audit

- All restoration operations are logged in the audit_log table
- Supports reversible operations as per existing requirements
- Detailed operation metadata for compliance reporting
- User-specific operation tracking and permissions
