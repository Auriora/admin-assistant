# Implementation Plan for Admin Assistant

This document outlines a detailed, step-by-step technical implementation plan for the Admin Assistant project. The plan is strictly sequential and dependency-aware, based on the SRS, design, and test documentation. It does not include time schedules or people resources.

---

## 1. Project Foundation & Core Infrastructure

### 1.1 Repository and Environment Setup
- Initialize the codebase structure as per `docs/GPT_AI_GUIDELINES.md`.
- Set up Python virtual environment and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Configure `.env` files for development, testing, and production.
- Set up logging and observability as per `docs/2-design/observability.md` and `docs/guidelines/observability.md`.
- Initialize the Flask app using the application factory pattern (`app/__init__.py`).
- Set up configuration management (`app/config.py`).

### 1.2 Database and Models
- Implement SQLAlchemy models in `app/models.py` based on `docs/2-design/data-model.md` and `data-model.puml`.
- Set up Alembic/Flask-Migrate for database migrations.
- Create initial migration and apply to development database.

### 1.3 Authentication & Authorization
- Integrate Microsoft OAuth2/OpenID Connect for authentication (Flask-OAuthlib/MSAL).
- Implement user session management and role scaffolding (single-user for MVP, but DB and code ready for multi-user/roles).
- Secure all routes and services to require authentication.

## 2. Core Functional Services and Business Logic

### 2.1 Calendar Archiving (FR-CAL-001 to FR-CAL-009)
- Implement Calendar Service in `app/services/calendar_service.py`:
  - Fetch appointments from Microsoft 365 via Graph API.
  - Copy appointments to archive calendar (handle time zones, recurring, overlaps, duplicates).
  - Make archived appointments immutable except for user.
  - Handle API rate limits, partial failures, and notifications.
- Implement background job for scheduled end-of-day archiving (Celery/RQ/Flask-APScheduler).
- Add manual archive trigger route and UI button.

### 2.2 Timesheet Extraction and Billing (FR-BIL-001 to FR-BIL-008)
- Implement Timesheet Service in `app/services/timesheet_service.py`:
  - Extract and categorize appointments from archive.
  - Integrate AI/rules for categorization (see below).
  - Generate PDF (using template or default), CSV, and Excel exports.
  - Integrate with OneDrive and Xero APIs for file upload.
  - Lock archive after billing, handle missed appointments.
  - Handle API failures and user notifications.

### 2.3 Location Recommendation (FR-LOC-001 to FR-LOC-004)
- Implement Location Service in `app/services/location_service.py`:
  - Recommend locations from fixed list and past data.
  - Allow user to add/auto-create locations.
  - Handle conflicts and prompt user as needed.

### 2.4 Travel Calculation (FR-TRV-001 to FR-TRV-008)
- Implement Travel Service in `app/services/travel_service.py`:
  - Calculate travel needs between appointments.
  - Integrate with Google Directions API (traffic, fallback, quota handling).
  - Add travel appointments to calendar/archive.
  - Notify user of issues (unreachable, insufficient time, etc.).

### 2.5 Categorization and Privacy (FR-CAT-001, FR-CAT-002, FR-PRI-001 to FR-PRI-003)
- Implement Categorization Service in `app/services/categorization_service.py`:
  - Use AI/rules for category recommendations.
  - Allow user override.
- Implement Privacy Service in `app/services/privacy_service.py`:
  - Automatically mark personal/travel as private.
  - Exclude private from exports.
  - Maintain privacy log and rollback via UI.

### 2.6 Out-of-Office Automation (FR-OOO-001)
- Implement OOO Service in `app/services/ooo_service.py`:
  - Mark appointments as OOO for selected period.
  - UI for OOO period selection and status.

### 2.7 Rules and Guidelines (FR-RUL-001 to FR-RUL-003)
- Implement Rules Service in `app/services/rules_service.py`:
  - CRUD for user-specific rules via UI.
  - Use rules in recommendations and automation.
  - Integrate with OpenAI for complex recommendations.

### 2.8 Audit Logging (FR-AUD-001, NFR-AUD-001 to NFR-AUD-003)
- Implement AuditLog model and service.
- Log all critical actions (archiving, export, API calls, errors, privacy, OOO, rules changes).
- UI for audit log viewing, searching, and exporting.

### 2.9 Notification Service (FR-NOT-001)
- Implement Notification Service in `app/services/notification_service.py`:
  - In-app and email notifications for errors, conflicts, and important events.
  - Configurable notification methods.

---

## 3. AI Integration (OpenAI) and Advanced Features

### 3.1 OpenAI Integration (FR-AI-001 to FR-AI-006)
- Implement AI Service in `app/services/ai_service.py`:
  - Sanitize and anonymize data before sending to OpenAI.
  - Use for categorization, rules, and recommendations.
  - Allow user to review/override AI output.
  - Handle API downtime, retries, and input sanitization.

### 3.2 Export Functionality (FR-EXP-001, FR-EXP-002)
- Implement export logic for CSV, Excel, and PDF (with special character and large dataset handling).
- UI for export options and download links.

### 3.3 Multi-user and Role Provisions (FR-MUL-001, FR-ROL-001, NFR-MUL-001, NFR-ROL-001/002)
- Add user/role fields to all models and services (already in DB).
- Enforce strict data isolation and role checks in all queries and business logic.
- UI for user/role management (admin only, for future).

## 4. User Interface Implementation

### 4.1 UI Foundation
- Set up Bootstrap and Jinja2 templates.
- Implement base layout, navigation, and authentication flows.

### 4.2 Feature-Specific UI
- **Dashboard:** Archive status, quick actions, notifications.
- **Calendar View:** Main and archive calendars, OOO status, privacy indicators.
- **Timesheet/Export Page:** Date picker, export options, category override prompts, upload status.
- **Location Management:** Location assignment, recommendations, conflict resolution.
- **Travel Appointments:** Travel calculation trigger, travel appointment list/alerts.
- **Rules/Guidelines Management:** CRUD UI for rules.
- **Audit Log:** Table with paging, search, export.
- **Notification Panel:** In-app notifications, settings.
- **Privacy Log:** Privacy status, rollback controls.

### 4.3 Accessibility and Responsiveness
- Ensure all UI components are accessible (keyboard, screen reader, color contrast).
- Make all pages responsive for mobile and desktop.

## 5. Testing Implementation

### 5.1 Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for all services, models, and utility functions using pytest.
- Mock external APIs for isolated testing.

### 5.2 Integration Tests
- Test route handlers, database interactions, and service integration.
- Use Flask test client and test database.

### 5.3 Functional/End-to-End Tests
- Implement tests for all major user flows as per `docs/4-testing/` (e.g., TC-CAL-001, TC-BIL-001, etc.).
- Cover both success and error scenarios.

### 5.4 Manual and Exploratory Testing
- Validate UI rendering, accessibility, and edge cases.
- Test notification delivery, export downloads, and error handling.

### 5.5 Observability and Logging Tests
