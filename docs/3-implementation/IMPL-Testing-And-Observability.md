# Testing and Observability Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive testing and observability implementation for the admin-assistant project, covering all new repositories, services, and archiving flows.

## Overview

The implementation includes:
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Unit and integration tests for all components
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Distributed tracing and metrics for archiving operations
- **Test Infrastructure**: Configuration, fixtures, and utilities for efficient testing
- **Coverage Requirements**: 80% minimum code coverage with detailed reporting

## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Configuration

#### `pytest.ini`
- Configured test discovery and execution
- Coverage reporting with 80% minimum threshold
- Test markers for categorization (unit, integration, slow, msgraph, db)
- Warning filters for clean test output

#### `tests/conftest.py`
- Global test fixtures for database sessions, users, and models
- Mock MS Graph client setup
- Sample data fixtures for consistent testing
- Automatic test logging configuration

### Tracing Integration

#### CalendarArchiveOrchestrator
```python
# Added comprehensive tracing with:
- Operation-level spans with detailed attributes

- Performance metrics collection
- Correlation ID propagation
```

#### CalendarArchiveService
```python
# Enhanced with:
- Function-level tracing
- Input/output metrics
- Error span status
- Processing statistics
```

### Metrics Collection

#### Archive Operations
- `archive_operations_total`: Counter for archive operations by status
- `archive_operation_duration_seconds`: Histogram of operation durations
- `archived_appointments_total`: Counter of successfully archived appointments
- `overlap_conflicts_total`: Counter of detected overlap conflicts

#### Appointment Processing
- `appointment_preparation_total`: Counter for preparation operations
- `appointments_processed_total`: Counter of processed appointments
- `overlap_detection_total`: Counter of overlap detections

### Observability Features

1. **Distributed Tracing**
   - End-to-end request tracing
   - Service boundary tracking
   - Error propagation visibility
   - Performance bottleneck identification

2. **Metrics Dashboard**
   - Operation success rates
   - Performance trends
   - Error rates and types
   - Resource utilization

3. **Correlation IDs**
   - Request tracking across services
   - Audit trail linkage
   - Debugging support

## Test Execution

### Test Runner Script

#### Development CLI (`./dev test`)
Comprehensive test execution with options:
- Unit tests only (`unit`)
- Integration tests only (`integration`)
- Archiving-specific tests (`archiving`)
- Observability tests (`observability`)
- Coverage reporting (`coverage`)
- Specific test execution (`specific`)
- Marker-based filtering (`marker`)

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
./dev test all --coverage

# Run only archiving tests
./dev test archiving --verbose

# Run unit tests with coverage
./dev test unit --coverage

# Run specific test file
./dev test specific tests/unit/services/test_calendar_archive_service_enhanced.py

# Run tests with specific marker
./dev test marker integration
```

## Coverage Requirements

### Minimum Coverage: 80%
- Enforced through pytest configuration
- HTML and terminal reporting
- Failure on coverage below threshold
- Detailed line-by-line coverage analysis

### Coverage Exclusions
- Test files themselves
