# Implementation Guide: Testing and Observability

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Created Date**: DD-MM-YYYY
- **Last Updated**: DD-MM-YYYY
- **Audience**: [Developers, SRE]
- **Scope**: Root

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive testing and observability implementation for the Admin Assistant project. It covers the test suite, OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing and metrics, test infrastructure, and coverage requirements, ensuring reliable and maintainable archiving operations.

## 2. Key Concepts

### 2.1. Testing Infrastructure

-   **`pytest.ini`**: Configures test discovery, execution, and coverage reporting (80% minimum threshold), including test markers and warning filters.
-   **`tests/conftest.py`**: Provides global test fixtures for database sessions, users, models, mock MS Graph clients, and sample data.
-   **Test Structure**: Tests are organized into `unit/`, `integration/`, and `utilities/` directories for clear categorization.

### 2.2. Test Coverage

-   **Repository Tests**: Comprehensive CRUD, user isolation, and error handling tests for `ArchiveConfigurationRepository` and `ActionLogRepository`.
-   **Service Tests**: Enhanced tests for `CalendarArchiveService`, `BackgroundJobService`, and `ScheduledArchiveService`, covering business logic, error handling, and external service integration.
-   **Orchestrator Tests**: End-to-end archiving workflow tests for `CalendarArchiveOrchestrator`, including error recovery, overlap resolution, and observability integration.
-   **Integration Tests**: `test_archiving_flow_integration.py` verifies the complete archiving workflow and service integration.

### 2.3. OpenTelemetry Implementation

-   **Tracing Integration**: Comprehensive tracing with operation-level spans, error tracking, performance metrics, and correlation ID propagation for `CalendarArchiveOrchestrator` and `CalendarArchiveService`.
-   **Metrics Collection**: Counters and histograms for archive operations (e.g., `archive_operations_total`, `archive_operation_duration_seconds`), archived appointments, and overlap conflicts.
-   **Observability Features**: Distributed tracing, metrics dashboards, and correlation IDs for end-to-end request tracking, performance bottleneck identification, and debugging.

## 3. Usage

### 3.1. Test Execution

The `./dev test` CLI provides comprehensive test execution options:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
./dev test all --coverage

# Run only archiving tests
./dev test archiving --verbose

# Run unit tests with coverage
./dev test unit --coverage

# Run specific test file
./dev test specific tests/unit/services/test_calendar_archive_service_enhanced.py

# Run tests with specific marker
./dev test marker integration
```

### 3.2. Coverage Requirements

-   **Minimum Coverage**: 80% enforced through pytest configuration, with HTML and terminal reporting.
-   **Exclusions**: Test files, migration scripts, development utilities, and external library integrations are excluded.

## 4. Internal Behaviour

### 4.1. Best Practices Implemented

-   **Test Organization**: Clear test categorization with markers, consistent fixture usage, and isolated test environments.
-   **Observability**: Meaningful span names and attributes, proper error status reporting, performance metric collection, and correlation ID usage.
-   **Maintainability**: Modular test structure, reusable fixtures, clear documentation, and automated test execution.

### 4.2. Monitoring and Alerting

-   **Recommended Metrics Alerts**: Set up for archive operation failure rates, average archive duration, overlap conflict rates, and test coverage.
-   **Dashboard Widgets**: Widgets for operation success rates, processing time trends, error rates by operation type, and test execution status.

## 5. Extension Points

### 5.1. Future Enhancements

-   **Planned Improvements**: Performance benchmarking, load testing, chaos engineering, advanced metrics and alerting, and test data generation utilities.
-   **Observability Roadmap**: Custom metrics for business KPIs, advanced tracing with sampling, log correlation with traces, and real-time monitoring dashboards.
