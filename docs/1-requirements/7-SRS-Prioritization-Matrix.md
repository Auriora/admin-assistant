### Rationale
- Requirements with the highest value and lowest complexity are prioritized first.
- Core security, reliability, compliance, and maintainability are implemented before advanced features.
- Features that are provisions for future scalability (multi-user, roles) are lower priority.
- AI-powered features are prioritized after core and UI features are stable.

### Implementation Order
1. Core Security, Reliability, Compliance, and Maintainability (NFR-SEC-001, NFR-REL-001, NFR-COM-001, NFR-MNT-001, NFR-PERF-001)
2. UI Foundation and Usability (NFR-USE-001, FR-UI-001)
3. Archiving and Timesheet Core (FR-CAL-001, FR-BIL-001, FR-BIL-003, FR-BIL-004)
4. Privacy and Out-of-Office (FR-PRI-001, FR-OOO-001)
5. Location and Travel (FR-LOC-001, FR-TRV-003)
6. AI/Rules Integration (FR-CAT-001, FR-AI-001, FR-RUL-001, FR-AI-002, NFR-AI-001)
7. Audit, Notification, Export, Backup (FR-AUD-001, FR-NOT-001, FR-EXP-001, NFR-AUD-001, NFR-BKP-001)
8. Multi-user/Role Provisions (FR-MUL-001, FR-ROL-001)

See the table above for detailed rationale and value/complexity analysis for each requirement.

### How to Use This Matrix

1. **List all requirements** in the table above, using their unique IDs
2. **Assign a MoSCoW priority** to each requirement:
   - **Must Have**: Critical requirements without which the system will not function
   - **Should Have**: Important requirements that should be included if possible
   - **Could Have**: Desirable requirements that can be omitted if necessary
   - **Won't Have**: Requirements that will not be implemented in the current version
3. **Rate the complexity** of implementing each requirement on a scale of 1-5:
   - **1**: Very simple, can be implemented quickly with minimal effort
   - **2**: Simple, requires moderate effort but no significant challenges
   - **3**: Moderate, requires significant effort but is well understood
   - **4**: Complex, requires substantial effort and may involve technical challenges
   - **5**: Very complex, requires extensive effort and involves significant technical challenges
4. **Rate the value** of each requirement on a scale of 1-5:
   - **1**: Minimal value, nice to have but not essential
   - **2**: Low value, provides some benefit to users
   - **3**: Moderate value, provides significant benefit to users
   - **4**: High value, provides substantial benefit to users
   - **5**: Critical value, essential for meeting user needs
5. **Calculate the Value/Complexity Ratio** (optional but helpful):
   - Divide the Value rating by the Complexity rating
   - Higher ratios indicate better "bang for your buck"
6. **Determine the implementation order** based on:
   - MoSCoW priority (implement "Must Have" items first)
   - Value/Complexity ratio (higher ratios should generally be implemented earlier)
   - Dependencies between requirements
7. **Document your rationale** for prioritization decisions

### Prioritization Strategies

Consider these strategies when prioritizing requirements:

1. **Risk-based prioritization**: Implement high-risk items early to address uncertainties
2. **Value-driven prioritization**: Focus on high-value items first to deliver business benefits quickly
3. **Dependency-based prioritization**: Implement prerequisites before dependent requirements
4. **Technical foundation prioritization**: Build core technical components before features that rely on them

### AI Assistance for Prioritization

Use these prompts with your AI assistant to help with the prioritization process:

- "Help me assess the complexity of implementing [requirement] on a scale of 1-5."
- "What would be the business or user value of [requirement] on a scale of 1-5?"
- "Are there any dependencies I should consider between these requirements?"
- "Based on these ratings, what would be a logical implementation order?"
- "What risks should I consider when prioritizing [requirement]?"
- "How might the complexity change if I implement [requirement A] before [requirement B]?"

### Example: Completed Prioritization Matrix

| FR-USR-001     | Must Have         | 2                | 5           | 2.5                    | 2                    | User authentication is essential for security and access control |
| NFR-SEC-001    | Must Have         | 2                | 5           | 2.5                    | 3                    | HTTPS is required for secure communications |
