## Overview

This document defines a comprehensive workflow for managing Outlook calendars to create accurate daily activity records for billing and record-keeping purposes. The workflow addresses the challenges of Outlook's dynamic appointment updates, overlapping appointments, and meeting modifications while maintaining accurate historical records.

## Problem Statement

Maintaining accurate activity records from Outlook calendars presents several interconnected challenges:

### Data Integrity Issues
- **Recurring appointment modifications**: Changes to recurring appointments update or remove past instances
- **Appointment cancellations**: Cancelled recurring appointments remove historical data
- **Meeting modifications**: Organizers can change meeting times, affecting attendee history
- **Duplicate appointments**: New appointments created for online meeting links

### Scheduling Conflicts and Overlaps
- **Overlapping appointments**: Multiple appointments can exist for the same time slot
- **No automated conflict detection**: Outlook itself cannot detect scheduling conflicts or overlaps
- **Unresolved overlaps**: Multiple valid appointments may exist for the same time period

### Manual Process Limitations
- **Manual travel time estimation**: Users must manually estimate and create travel appointments
- **Missing travel appointments**: Users may forget to create travel appointments for customer meetings
- **Inconsistent category naming**: Users may apply different formats or naming conventions
- **No built-in validation**: No automatic validation of category format consistency

### Reporting and Analytics Gaps
- **Limited reporting capabilities**: Outlook provides limited reporting directly from calendar data

## Workflow Objectives

1. **Maintain accurate historical records** of all calendar activities
2. **Work exclusively within Outlook** without requiring external applications
3. **Enable automated processing** by the admin-assistant system
4. **Support billing and timesheet generation** with accurate time tracking
5. **Handle edge cases** like overlaps, modifications, and travel time

## Solution Overview

This workflow addresses the identified challenges through a comprehensive approach that combines Outlook's native features with automated admin-assistant processing:

### Archive-Based Historical Preservation
The primary calendar serves as a **scheduling and planning tool**, while the Activity Archive maintains the **historical record**. Regular archiving captures appointment states before modifications occur, ensuring historical integrity is preserved regardless of primary calendar changes.

### Automated Processing and Validation
The admin-assistant system provides:
- **Category format validation** during archiving (can also be scheduled as a separate job)
- **Travel time automation** using Google Directions API with automated detection and creation
- **Automated overlap resolution** using priority-based rules with user notification for remaining conflicts
- **Regular audit and standardization** processes to maintain category consistency

### Enhanced Reporting and Analytics
- **Dashboard reporting** via web interface and/or email dashboard for calendar analytics
- **Conflict alerts** through email notifications for scheduling issues
- **Archive calendar preservation** maintaining immutable records despite primary calendar modifications

### Calendar-Agnostic Design
Future consideration to apply similar workflows to other calendar tools (Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, etc.) ensuring the approach is not limited to Outlook.

## Core Workflow Components

### 1. Appointment Categorization System

#### Current Implementation
Use Outlook's **Categories** feature to mark appointments with the following format:
```
<customer name> - <billing type>
```

**Billing Types:**
- `billable`: Time that can be charged to the customer
- `non-billable`: Time spent on customer work that cannot be charged

**Examples:**
- `Acme Corp - billable`
- `Acme Corp - non-billable`

#### Category Management Guidelines
1. **Consistency**: Always use the exact format `<customer name> - <billing type>`
2. **Customer Names**: Use consistent customer names across all appointments
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Maintain consistent capitalization
4. **Special Categories**:
   - `Admin - non-billable`: For administrative tasks
   - `Break - non-billable`: For breaks and lunch
   - `Online`: For appointments taken remotely via online calls (no travel required)
   - **Personal appointments**: Mark as **Private** (no category required)

#### Admin-Assistant Integration
The admin-assistant system will:
- **Parse categories** to extract customer name and billing type
- **Validate category formats** during archiving process
- **Handle special categories** including Online appointments and Private personal appointments

#### Validation
- [ ] All work appointments have proper category format `<customer name> - <billing type>`
- [ ] Personal appointments marked as Private
- [ ] Online appointments marked with 'Online' category
- [ ] Category naming is consistent across all appointments

### 2. Travel Appointment Management

#### Travel Appointment Creation
Create separate travel appointments before and after customer appointments:

**Travel Appointment Properties:**
- **Subject**: `Travel`
- **Category**: `<customer name> - billable`
- **Duration**: Estimated travel time
- **Location**: Leave blank

**Timing Guidelines:**
- **Before appointment**: Schedule travel from home (or previous location) to appointment location, arriving 5-10 minutes early
- **After appointment**: Schedule travel from appointment location to next destination or home
- **Note**: Some appointments will be at the same location, requiring no travel between them

#### Travel Time Calculation
The admin-assistant system will:
1. Use Google Directions API for accurate travel time estimates
2. Consider traffic predictions when available
3. Handle multi-day trips and special cases
4. Alert users when insufficient travel time exists between appointments
5. **Automatically mark appointments as Out-of-Office** when travel appointments are added and location is not Home/Office
6. **Skip travel creation** for appointments marked with `Online` category

#### Admin-Assistant Integration
The admin-assistant system will:
- **Detect missing travel appointments** and suggest creation
- **Validate travel time** between appointments using Google Directions API
- **Auto-mark Out-of-Office** for appointments with travel to non-Home/Office locations
- **Skip travel processing** for Online appointments

#### Validation
- [ ] Travel appointments created for customer meetings (excluding Online appointments)
- [ ] Travel appointments have correct customer category with 'billable' billing type
- [ ] Travel location field left blank
- [ ] Appointments with travel to non-Home/Office locations marked as Out-of-Office

### 3. Handling Overlapping Appointments

#### Priority Flag System
Use Outlook's **Priority** field to resolve overlapping appointments:

**Priority Levels:**
- **High**: Primary appointment (takes precedence in overlaps)
- **Normal**: Standard appointment
- **Low**: Secondary appointment (deprioritized in overlaps)

#### Overlap Resolution Process
1. **Detection**: Admin-assistant detects overlapping appointments during archiving
2. **Automatic Resolution Rules** (applied in order):
   - **Ignore 'Free' appointments**: Appointments marked as 'Free' are excluded from archiving
   - **Discard 'Tentative' appointments**: Tentative appointments are discarded in favor of confirmed appointments
   - **Priority Check**: System checks priority flags to determine primary appointment among remaining appointments
3. **User Notification**: System logs remaining overlaps and notifies user for manual resolution
4. **Manual Resolution Options**:
   - Keep highest priority appointment
   - Merge appointments with combined duration
   - Split time between appointments
   - Manual time adjustment

#### Admin-Assistant Integration
The admin-assistant system will:
- **Detect overlapping appointments** during archiving process
- **Apply automatic resolution rules** in order: Free → Tentative → Priority
- **Log remaining conflicts** for user resolution
- **Use Show As status** for overlap resolution (Free = ignore, Tentative = lower priority)

#### Validation
- [ ] Priority flags set for overlapping appointments
- [ ] Show As status set appropriately (Free for non-work time, Tentative for uncertain appointments)
- [ ] Overlapping appointments resolved or logged for manual resolution

### 4. Meeting Modification Handling

| Modification Type | Subject | Category | Duration | Start Time | Priority | Process Description |
|-------------------|---------|----------|----------|------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Meeting Extension** | `Extension` | Same as original appointment | Extension time (e.g., 30 minutes) | Original appointment end time | Low | Create new appointment immediately after original appointment |
| **Meeting Shortening** | `Shortened` | Same as original appointment | Time reduced (e.g., 15 minutes) | New end time of shortened meeting | Low | Create overlapping appointment indicating reduction |
| **Early Start** | `Early Start` | Same as original appointment | Early start time | Before original start time | Low | Create appointment before original start time |
| **Late Start** | `Late Start` | Same as original appointment | Delay time | Original start time | Low | Create appointment for missed time |

**Notes:**
- All modification appointments use **Low priority** to indicate they are modification markers
- **Category** should always match the original appointment to maintain billing consistency
- **Duration** represents the time difference, not the total meeting time

#### Admin-Assistant Integration
The admin-assistant system will:
- **Recognize modification keywords** in appointment subjects
- **Merge extensions** with original appointments during archiving
- **Subtract shortened time** from original appointments
- **Adjust start times** for early/late starts

#### Validation
- [ ] Extension/shortening appointments created as needed
- [ ] All modification appointments use Low priority
- [ ] Modification appointments have same category as original
- [ ] Duration represents time difference, not total meeting time

### 5. Archive Calendar Management

#### Archive Calendar Setup
1. **Create dedicated archive calendar** in Outlook
2. **Name**: `Activity Archive` (indefinite, not yearly)
3. **Purpose**: Immutable record of all activities
4. **Access**: Read-only after archiving (user can modify if needed)

#### Archiving Process
The admin-assistant system will:
1. **Daily archiving**: Copy all appointments from main calendar to archive
2. **Conflict resolution**: Process overlaps and modifications
3. **Time adjustment**: Apply extensions, shortenings, and timing modifications
4. **Validation**: Ensure all time is accounted for and properly categorized

#### Admin-Assistant Integration
The admin-assistant system will:
- **Filter appointments** excluding 'Free' appointments from archiving
- **Apply all processing rules** from sections 1-4 during archiving
- **Maintain immutable records** in the archive calendar
- **Generate comprehensive reports** from archived data

#### Validation
- [ ] Archive calendar configured and accessible
- [ ] Daily archiving process operational
- [ ] All processing rules applied during archiving
- [ ] Archive maintains immutable historical records

## Timesheet Generation and Reporting

### PDF Timesheet Generation
