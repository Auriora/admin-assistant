# Outlook Calendar Management Workflow for Daily Activity Records

- **Owner**: Auriora Team
- **Status**: Approved
- **Created Date**: 2024-12-19
- **Last Updated**: 2024-12-19
- **Audience**: [Developers, Users]

## 1. Purpose

This document defines a comprehensive workflow for managing Outlook calendars to create accurate daily activity records for billing and record-keeping purposes. The workflow addresses the challenges of Outlook's dynamic appointment updates, overlapping appointments, and meeting modifications while maintaining accurate historical records.

### Problem Statement

Maintaining accurate activity records from Outlook calendars presents several interconnected challenges:

- **Data Integrity Issues**: Recurring appointment modifications, cancellations, and organizer changes can lead to loss of historical data.
- **Scheduling Conflicts and Overlaps**: Outlook does not automatically detect or resolve overlapping appointments.
- **Manual Process Limitations**: Manual travel time estimation, inconsistent categorization, and lack of validation lead to errors.
- **Reporting and Analytics Gaps**: Outlook has limited reporting capabilities for calendar data.

### Workflow Objectives

1.  **Maintain accurate historical records** of all calendar activities.
2.  **Work exclusively within Outlook** without requiring external applications for the user.
3.  **Enable automated processing** by the admin-assistant system.
4.  **Support billing and timesheet generation** with accurate time tracking.
5.  **Handle edge cases** like overlaps, modifications, and travel time.

## 2. Context

### Solution Overview

This workflow addresses the identified challenges through a comprehensive approach that combines Outlook's native features with automated admin-assistant processing:

-   **Archive-Based Historical Preservation**: The primary calendar serves as a scheduling tool, while an `Activity Archive` calendar maintains the historical record.
-   **Automated Processing and Validation**: The admin-assistant system provides category validation, travel time automation, and overlap resolution.
-   **Enhanced Reporting and Analytics**: The system offers dashboard reporting, conflict alerts, and immutable archive records.
-   **Calendar-Agnostic Design**: The workflow is designed to be adaptable to other calendar tools in the future.

## 3. Details

### Core Workflow Components

#### 1. Appointment Categorization System

-   **Format**: `<customer name> - <billing type>` (e.g., `Acme Corp - billable`).
-   **Special Categories**: `Admin - non-billable`, `Break - non-billable`, `Online`.
-   **Personal Appointments**: Mark as **Private**.

#### 2. Travel Appointment Management

-   **Creation**: Separate `Travel` appointments with the customer category.
-   **Automation**: The admin-assistant uses the Google Directions API to calculate travel time and create appointments, marking them as Out-of-Office.

#### 3. Handling Overlapping Appointments

-   **Priority System**: Use Outlook's **Priority** field (High, Normal, Low) to indicate precedence.
-   **Resolution**: The admin-assistant automatically resolves overlaps based on `Free` status, `Tentative` status, and then priority. Unresolved conflicts are flagged for the user.

#### 4. Meeting Modification Handling

-   **Keywords**: Use subject keywords like `Extension`, `Shortened`, `Early Start`, `Late Start` to create low-priority appointments that modify the original.
-   **Processing**: The admin-assistant merges or adjusts appointments based on these keywords.

#### 5. Archive Calendar Management

-   **Setup**: A dedicated `Activity Archive` calendar.
-   **Process**: The system performs daily archiving, applying all processing and validation rules.

### Timesheet Generation and Reporting

-   **PDF Generation**: The system generates professional, template-based PDF timesheets from the `Activity Archive`.
-   **Xero Integration**: Automatically create or update Xero invoices and attach the PDF timesheet.
-   **Client Communication**: Optionally, send weekly timesheets to clients via email.

## 4. Decisions / Actions

### Implementation Guidelines

1.  **Phase 1: Basic Categorization**: Start with consistent categorization and manual travel appointments.
2.  **Phase 2: Modification Handling**: Implement modification keywords and priority flags.
3.  **Phase 3: Full Integration**: Configure the admin-assistant for full automation.

### Success Metrics

-   **Historical Integrity**: 100% of activities preserved.
-   **Automation Rate**: 90%+ of routine tasks automated.
-   **Billing Accuracy**: <5% manual adjustment needed for timesheets.
-   **Overlap Resolution**: 95%+ of overlaps resolved automatically.

### Next Steps

1.  Review and approve this workflow.
2.  Configure Outlook with categories and the archive calendar.
3.  Test the workflow with sample data.
4.  Integrate with the admin-assistant system.
5.  Train users on the procedures.
