# Solo Developer AI-Driven Process for Admin Assistant

## Introduction

This document outlines a radically simplified development process designed specifically for a solo developer using an AI assistant for 80-90% of the development
work on the Admin Assistant project. It eliminates unnecessary ceremonies and processes that don't add value in a single-developer context.

## Core Principles

1. **Minimize Process Overhead**: Eliminate all ceremonies and documentation that don't directly contribute to product quality
2. **Maximize AI Leverage**: Use AI for as much of the development work as possible
3. **Focus on Outcomes**: Prioritize working software over comprehensive documentation
4. **Iterative Development**: Build small, testable increments rather than large batches of work

## Streamlined Process Overview

The entire development process is condensed into three simple phases:

1. **Plan**: Define what to build
2. **Build**: Create the software with AI assistance
3. **Verify**: Ensure it works correctly

## 1. Plan Phase

**Time Investment**: 10-15% of total development time

### Activities:

- Maintain a simple prioritized list of features/tasks
- For each feature, write a brief description of what it should do
- Sketch any necessary UI elements or data structures

### Tools:

- Simple text file or markdown document for the task list
- Basic drawing tools for sketches (can be paper)

### AI Utilization:

- Use AI to help refine feature descriptions
- Ask AI to suggest edge cases to consider
- Have AI generate initial data models based on requirements

## 2. Build Phase

**Time Investment**: 70-80% of total development time

### Activities:

- Write effective prompts for the AI assistant
- Review and refine AI-generated code
- Integrate components and resolve any issues
- Document key design decisions (minimal, focused on future maintenance)

### Tools:

- IDE with AI coding assistant
- Version control (simple workflow - no complex branching)
- Automated testing tools

### AI Utilization:

- Generate initial code implementations
- Refactor and optimize existing code
- Create test cases
- Generate documentation
- Debug issues

### Effective Prompting Techniques:

- Be specific about the desired outcome
- Include context about the existing codebase
- Specify any constraints or requirements
- Ask for explanations of complex logic
- Request multiple approaches for critical components

## 3. Verify Phase

**Time Investment**: 10-15% of total development time

### Activities:

- Run automated tests
- Manually test key user flows
- Fix any issues found
- Verify performance and security

### Tools:

- Automated testing framework
- Basic performance monitoring tools

### AI Utilization:

- Generate additional test cases
- Analyze code for potential issues
- Suggest performance improvements
- Help troubleshoot bugs

## Implementation Example

### Feature: Enhanced Overlap Resolution Service

#### Plan (15 minutes):

- Write brief description: "Implement automatic overlap resolution using Show As status and Priority rules"
- List key requirements: Free appointment filtering, Tentative vs Confirmed resolution, Priority-based final resolution
- Ask AI to suggest edge cases (missing status fields, equal priorities, etc.)

#### Build (3-4 hours):

- Prompt AI to generate initial implementation of EnhancedOverlapResolutionService class
- Review, test, and refine the generated code
- Prompt AI to create comprehensive unit tests for all resolution scenarios
- Integrate with existing CalendarArchiveOrchestrator
- Document key design decisions and resolution rules

#### Verify (30 minutes):

- Run automated tests with various overlap scenarios
- Manually test with real Outlook appointment data
- Test error handling for edge cases (missing fields, malformed data)
- Fix any issues with AI assistance

## Tracking Progress

For a solo developer, complex tracking systems add unnecessary overhead. Instead:

- Maintain a simple list of features with statuses (To Do, In Progress, Done)
- Track only essential metrics that provide value:
    - Features completed per week
    - Known bugs/issues
    - Test coverage for critical components

## When to Add More Process

This minimal process works well for most features. Consider adding more structure only when:

1. Working on high-risk features that could impact data integrity
2. Implementing complex algorithms where correctness is critical
3. Making significant architectural changes

## Conclusion

This streamlined process eliminates the overhead of traditional Agile methodologies while maintaining the benefits of iterative development. By leveraging AI
for 80-90% of the development work, a solo developer can focus on the creative and strategic aspects of software development rather than routine coding tasks.

The process is designed to be flexible and can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the project and the developer's working style. The key is to maintain
a balance between minimizing process overhead and ensuring software quality.
