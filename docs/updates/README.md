- **Status**: Approved
- **Created Date**: 27-10-2023
- **Last Updated**: 27-10-2023

## 1. Purpose

**When to use this template**: This directory contains a chronological log of significant, human-authored updates. Think of it as a project diary or a changelog that explains the *why* and *what* of a change.
**Location**: `docs/updates/`

## 2. What Belongs Here?

- Summaries of major feature implementations.
- Notes on significant refactoring or dependency changes.
- Manual records of important events not captured elsewhere.
- Entries should follow the naming convention: `DD-MM-YYYY-descriptive-slug.md`.

## 3. What Does NOT Belong Here?

- Automated reports (see `../reports/`).
- Formal architectural decisions (see `../2-architecture/`).

## 4. Usage Notes

- **Checklist for Authors**:
  - [ ] Fill in all placeholder values (e.g., `[Name or Team]`).
  - [ ] Delete this `Usage Notes` section before publishing.
  - [ ] Ensure the document is linked from the relevant `README.md` file.

- **Naming Convention**: `DD-MM-YYYY-descriptive-slug.md`

## 5. Available Templates

- `_template.md`: A generic template for any update log entry.
