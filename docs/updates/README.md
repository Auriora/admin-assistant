# Updates Log

Use this directory to record task-scoped implementation notes. Each entry should explain the *why* and *what* of the change, reference related issues or PRs, and note which `.agents/rules/` documents were consulted.

- File naming: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug.md`
- Start each entry by linking the associated PR or issue when available.
- Update `index.md` with a bullet linking to the new entry (newest first) so the history stays discoverable.
