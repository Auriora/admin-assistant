## 1. Purpose

This report summarizes recent changes and improvements to the test suite. Use this document to communicate progress to stakeholders and link to detailed reports. Clearly state the objective and scope of this report.

## 2. Detailed Findings

### Improvements
- Added unit tests for critical modules (list modules or PRs here).
- Introduced CI coverage publishing and baseline `COVERAGE_REPORT.md`.
- Added test flakiness tracking and quarantine process (`tests/FLAKY.md`).
- Added test-related automation (e.g., test matrix, caching, parallelism).

### Impact
- Expected increase in baseline coverage to {{expected_coverage}}%.
- Reduced regressions by {{estimated_regression_reduction}}% (replace with measured values).
- CI runtime impact: tests now run in {{ci_test_duration}} minutes on average.

### Metrics & Evidence
- Coverage report: `docs/reports/COVERAGE_REPORT.md`
- Code quality: `docs/reports/Code-Quality-Report.md`
- Security findings that affected tests: `docs/reports/Security-Review-Report.md`
- Improvement plan: `docs/reports/Test-Coverage-Improvement-Plan.md`

## 3. Recommendations

List any action items or next steps based on the report's findings.

- **Action 1**: Finish targeted tests for modules listed in `COVERAGE_REPORT.md`.
- **Action 2**: Add CI gating rules to enforce coverage thresholds for new PRs.
- **Action 3**: Monitor flaky tests and reduce quarantine list by 50% over next quarter.
