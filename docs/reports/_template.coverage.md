## 1. Purpose

This report provides a summary of the project's test coverage. Clearly state the objective and scope of this report.

## 2. Detailed Findings

### Coverage Summary
- Overall coverage: {{overall_coverage_percent}}%  (update from CI coverage artifact)
- Lines/Branches: lines={{lines_coverage_percent}}%, branches={{branches_coverage_percent}}%
- Measurement date: {{measurement_date}}

### How to reproduce
- Run tests with coverage locally or in CI:

  - pytest --cov=src --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term

- Upload or inspect `coverage.xml`/HTML report for module-level details.

### Breakdown by Module
| Module | Lines | Covered | % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| example | 100 | 80 | 80% |

Replace the above table with actual module rows from the coverage report. For projects with many modules, include the top N modules with the lowest %.

### Notable Gaps
- Modules with < {{low_coverage_threshold}}% coverage (replace threshold placeholder):
  - {{module_name}} â€” missing tests for XYZ functions (brief rationale)

- Categories to prioritise: business logic, security-sensitive code, public API surface, and any recently modified modules.

## 3. Recommendations

List any action items or next steps based on the report's findings.

- **Action 1**: Add unit tests for modules listed above. Owner: @dev-team. Due: {{due_date}}
- **Action 2**: Add integration tests for key flows that cross module boundaries. Owner: @qa-team.
- **Action 3**: Configure CI to publish coverage artifacts and fail PRs when overall coverage drops below {{ci_threshold}}%.
- **Action 4**: Run periodic coverage audits (monthly) and link results in `docs/reports/`.

# References

- Provide links to the raw output or the tool that generated the report.
- Link to additional resources, specifications, or related tickets.

### Notes
- Use this file as the canonical, short summary for release notes and planning.
- Replace placeholders ({{...}}) with values from CI, coverage tooling, or project trackers.
