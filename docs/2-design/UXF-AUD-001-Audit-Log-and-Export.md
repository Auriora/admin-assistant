@startuml
actor User
participant "Web UI" as UI
participant "Backend Service" as BE
database "Audit Log" as Log

User -> UI: Navigates to Audit Log page
UI -> BE: Request audit log data (with filters/search)
BE -> Log: Fetch audit log entries
Log --> BE: Return log data
BE -> UI: Show log entries
User -> UI: Searches/filters/exports log
UI -> BE: Request filtered/exported data
BE -> Log: Fetch/process data

### Step-by-Step Flow

| Step # | Actor        | Action                                      | System Response                                      | UI Elements                | Notes                                  |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1      | User         | Navigates to Audit Log page                 | Loads audit log entries (paged, filtered)            | Audit log table, filters   |                                        |
| 2      | User         | Searches or filters log entries             | Sends search/filter request to backend               | Search/filter controls     |                                        |
| 3      | Backend      | Fetches filtered log data                   | Returns filtered/paged results                      | N/A                        |                                        |
| 4      | User         | Requests export of log data                 | Sends export request to backend                      | Export button              |                                        |
| 5      | Backend      | Processes export, provides download link    | User downloads exported file (CSV/Excel/PDF)         | Download link              |                                        |

### Exit Points
- User views, searches, and/or exports audit log data.
- User is notified of any errors and can retry or seek help.
- System logs all export actions for audit purposes.

### Error Scenarios

| Error Scenario         | Trigger                                 | System Response                                 | User Recovery Action                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Export Failure        | File generation or download error        | Shows error, allows retry                       | Retry export                        |
| Log Fetch Failure     | Backend/database error                   | Shows error, allows retry                       | Retry fetch                         |
| Auth Expired          | User session/token expired               | Prompts user to re-authenticate                 | Log in again                        |

## UI Components
- Audit log table with paging, search, and filter controls
- Export button and download link
- Success/Error notification banners or modals

## Accessibility Considerations
- All controls accessible via keyboard and screen readers
- Sufficient color contrast for log entries and error messages
- Clear, actionable error messages and prompts

## Performance Expectations
- Log fetches and exports should complete within a few seconds for typical data volumes
- UI should remain responsive during backend operations
- System should handle fetch and export errors gracefully

## Related Flows
- All flows that generate audit log entries (archiving, export, etc.)
- Error Notification Flow (UXF-NOT-001)

## Notes
- All audit log actions and exports are logged for compliance
- Future: Support for multi-user and admin troubleshooting
